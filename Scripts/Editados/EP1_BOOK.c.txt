The name's Kyle Hyde.
I used to be a New York
cop, but three years ago
I gave up my badge and
became a salesman with 
a joint called Red Crown.
I use the gig to search
for a man named Bradley.
Bradley was undercover,
investigating a crime
syndicate known as Nile,
when he sold us out.
I found him, put a bullet
in him, and saw him sink
into the Hudson. Now
he's missing.
But back to the present.
It's December 28, 1979,
and my boss, Ed, told me
to get my butt to a dive 
called Hotel Dusk. I help
Ed with a side business, 
which is finding things that
don't want to be found.
I arrive, check in, and get
the key to Room 215. A
guy named Dunning Smith,
the owner, tells me that 
215 grants wishes. I also
learn that a guest with 
my name stayed in the
hotel a little while back.
On the way to my room, I
meet a kid named Melissa.
She tricks me into solving
a jigsaw puzzle for her,
but once it's done she
throws it down. I make
her pick 'em up, but she
forgets one.
I get to Room 215 and
take a breather. But
trouble won't leave me be,
and I break my key trying
to open my suitcase. I
have to pay up front, so
I need to get the thing
open and find my cash.
Ed's package shows and
the bellhop brings it up.
Bellhop turns out to be a
street rat I know by the
name of Louie DeNonno.
Says he's clean now, but
I've got a hunch there's
more going on there.
Louie brought me the
wrong package, so I head
for the front desk to
straighten things out. Near
the front desk, I see a
girl I passed coming here.
Name's Mila, and she's
wearing Bradley's bracelet.
Guy named Jeff in 213
gave Mila a lift. Problem
is, Mila's got no luggage 
and she's a mute. Rosa,
the maid, feels sorry for
her and takes her under
her large wing.
A guy named Summer calls
the front desk and tells
them he has my package.
He drops it by my room, 
and after a lot of hand-
wringing and fifty-cent
words, I finally get the
stuff Ed sent me.
Inside the box is a list of 
items I'm supposed to find
and some new products.
The items are a small red
box and a men's magazine.
I give Rachel a buzz and
tell her I got the goods,
then I go to work.
