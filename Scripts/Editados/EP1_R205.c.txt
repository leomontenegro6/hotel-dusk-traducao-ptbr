Escuta, me faz um favor.
Passa uma mensagem ao Ed.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Diz pra ele que não precisa

Valeu pelo voto de confiança,

Olha, nem em sonho eu falaria

Você não é exatamente um

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
É por isso que existem todos
esses rumores...

<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Que rumores?


<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Não finja que não sabe! 
Ouvi falar de umas coisas bem
bem loucas a seu respeito.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Você é um ex-policial de Nova
Iorque envolvido em esquemas
que precisou sair da cidade?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Ou um homem misterioso
fugindo de alguma organização
sombria?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
As pessoas comentam todo

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Quer saber o que eu acho?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Acho que você é um bonitão
acabado que se afundou na
bebida e nunca mais parou.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Eu não engulo nem um

"homem misterioso".

<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Ainda não. Quem sabe o

afundou na bebida.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Hmm...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Isso é tudo que tem dentro

<b 0135>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Não, também tem alguns
produtos novos.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Produtos novos? E o que eu
deveria fazer com eles?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Você é um vendedor, Kyle.
Tente vender alguma coisa.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Ah, e essas são ordens do
Ed. Não minhas.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Vender porta a porta em
um hotel? Isso vai ser no

<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Ah, e mais uma coisa.
Também coloquei a lista
de clientes no pacote.

Ah, aquilo.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>

But, Kyle, you're not
exactly an open book.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
And people are saying all kinds
of things, sweetie, and most
of them aren't very nice.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Like that you're an ex-cop 
from New York who was on
the take and split town?

Or a mystery man on the

Is that it?

Listen, Kyle... Your past is

No, there are some new

New products? What am I
supposed to do with them?

You're a salesman, Kyle.
Try selling something.

Door-to-door sales in a
