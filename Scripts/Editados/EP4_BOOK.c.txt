After I get the key to 217
from Louie, I go in and
give it the once-over. I
find Bradley's lighter and 
a photo of a man and a
young girl. Now I've got
proof that Bradley really
was here.
I return to 215 and find
the floor soaked. I check
the bathroom and discover
a plastic bag full of loot
in the toilet tank. No way
it got there by magic, so
that's one more problem. 
I head to the front desk
and find Jeff telling
Dunning he's been robbed.
Punk demands that the
old man search every
guest's belongings. From
my end, it sounds like he's
missing some cash.
Rosa waylays me and gets
me to help her secure
Summer's autograph. I take
her book to Summer and
learn that he's lost his
fountain pen. I show him
the pen Louie found, and
he says it's his.
I notice a passage from
Summer's book is identical
to what was written in his
old notebook. Then Rosa
tells me that Summer's
real name isn't Alan. I 
decide that we need to
have another chat.
Summer folds like a card
table and tells me that
his debut novel was stolen
from a friend of his
named Alan. Before he
went missing, Alan told
Summer that Hotel Dusk
was special to him.
