What is it, Mr. Hyde?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000101><n 0>
I got Summer's autograph.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
What? You did? Are you
serious? Don't fool ol'
Rosa!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000309><n 0>
Oh, this is wonderful!


<sprite 0000125><color red>You really that happy?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Getting Summer's signature
really make you that happy?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
Of course it does! That gives
me fifty!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
And fifty is nothing to sneeze 
at, let me tell you!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Fifty what?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Autographs, silly! I'm an 
autograph hound. I collect
famous signatures.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
And Mr. Summer's is number
fifty.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Got a thing for famous
people's handwriting, huh?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
I wouldn't put it that way,
but yes, I suppose so. Yes.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
I got my first one while
waitressing at a little
diner in Santa Monica.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Funny enough, it was another
novelist. To think it's been
sixteen years...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Well, I've been picking them
up here and there, and now
I've got fifty.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
You can see why I'm so
happy now, can't you?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
So what's special about
Summer's autograph?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
It's how he writes the "er"
in Summer.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000317><n 0>
Look closely and you can
see how distinct it is.

<b 0245>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000119><n 0>
...I guess.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
And it's been like that for
a long, long time.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
He said in an interview that
he's been writing that way
since he was a child.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
The letters "e-r," huh?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
This sort of handwriting
indicates someone who
tells audacious lies.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
But it indicates the person
is a bit of a coward, as well.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You cook, clean, and do
handwriting analysis?
You're a marvel, Rosa.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
Poke fun all you want, Mr.
Hyde, but there's truth to
be found in penmanship!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
<color blue>A lying coward, huh?<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>Sounds like a fair description<color white>
<color blue>of writers to me.<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Here you go.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000317><n 0>
Where is it?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000317><n 0>
Is this really HIS signature?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000315><n 0>
You didn't write this yourself,
did you?

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000124><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Forgery isn't my bag.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000314><n 0>
Ha ha ha! I'm just teasing
you.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
I know for a fact that this
is really Mr. Summer's
autograph. Mmm-hmm!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000317><n 0>
You see, Mr. Summer has
a particular way of signing
his name.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000317><n 0>
I read a magazine interview
where they discussed his
<color red>distinctive penmanship<color white>.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000307><n 0>
...Oh my goodness!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
If you've got that kind of
money, why are you
staying here?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
What're you writing?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
What're you looking at?


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000302><n 0>
So, where's my book?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Tell me something, will you?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000302><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
What?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
When was this book first
published?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
Well, it won a Mystery of
the Year award in 1969,
so...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
Ten years ago.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You have any more books
by this guy?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
No, the only one I have is
The Secret Word.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
This may sound rude, but I
think it's the only one worth
owning, really.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
That so?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
Yes it is, Mr. Hyde!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Summer published several
books after The Secret
Word, but...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
None of them really took
off, as they say.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
I'm not sure if he's what
they call a one-hit wonder,
but who knows?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
I'm sure it's no easy task
writing a best seller, after
all!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
He must live fairly well off
royalties, and that's
something, right?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Sure it is.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Got one more thing to ask
you.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Is Martin Summer a pen
name?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
No, sir! Uh-uh!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
That's his real name. I'm
as sure of that as I am
of anything.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
That's pretty sure.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>So all that business about<color white>
<color blue>a pen name was a cartload<color white>
<color blue>of bull.<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
What's going on, Mr. Hyde?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000122><n 0>
Nothing, Rosa. I'm just being
nosy.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Thanks. See you later.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
Sure.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
And thank YOU, Mr. Hyde.
