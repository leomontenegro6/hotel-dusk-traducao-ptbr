and here you are!

Something happen?

It's Mila. She's not feeling 
very well, poor thing!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
She's running a fever!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
How bad?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
She seems tired, but I think
that's the worst of it. At
least for now.

I'm going to run to the front
desk and get some medicine.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
Do me a favor. Go to my
room and watch her until
I get back. OK? Good!
