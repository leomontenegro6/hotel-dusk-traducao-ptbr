Tell me about the hotel's
history.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000206><n 0>
Its history?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000206><n 0>
Now why'n the Sam Hill ya
wanna go askin' 'bout that
nonsense?!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'm a curious guy.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Look, I was just down in the
bar, and someone told me
a little bit about it.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Said the bar was built for the
hotel's tenth anniversary.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That true?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000203><n 0>
So ya heard, did ya?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
When was this place built?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Oh, 'bout twenty years ago,
give'r take.

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Back then, place was whatch'd 
call real popular.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Used'a have bands playin' in
the restaurant, even.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
And weekends were outta
control! Wild parties and
everythin'!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Sounds like it was the place
to be.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000203><n 0>
Yep. Used t'be all right...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
But <color red>by the time I took over<color white>,
the place'd changed.

<sprite 0000125><color red>When did Dunning take over?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
No more parties or fancy
bands. Reputation just 
went down the crapper. 
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Has it always been called 
Hotel Dusk?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000203><n 0>
Yep, yep. Been the same
since Day One.

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
'Parently, the fella who built
the place gave it that handle.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Went up on the roof after
they'd finished buildin', and
took a look at the sunset.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Fella was so impressed, he
named the joint Hotel Dusk.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Leastwise, that's what I heard.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Yep, I thought about renamin'
the place <color red>when I started<color white>
<color red>runnin' it<color white>.
<sprite 0000125><color red>When did Dunning take over?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
But when I heard how much it 
costs t'change a damn sign, 
I 'bout near fainted!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So what were you staring at 
when I came in?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000202><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>

place in there.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
They're all pictures'a guests

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000203><n 0>
Real comedian, ain't ya, Hyde?
...'Course, they're all up'n 
gone now.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000205><n 0>
Shucks. Even a hard-ass like
me can get a bit weepy 
thinkin' 'bout the past...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What did you do before you
ran this place?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
What, ya mean my job?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
Ain't no business'a yours!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Hey, just curious.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You're a real piece of work, 
Dunning. Makes me wonder
how you got started.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000215><n 0>
Well, I'll save ya the trouble
of listenin'!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Ain't a man alive with a life
story more borin' than mine!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I ain't got a damn thing ya'd

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
If you say so.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Tell me something, Dunning.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
How does a guy like you get
into hotel management?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Aw, it ain't nothin' special.
I was just yer average
paper pusher, ya know?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
You saved up enough money
to buy a hotel by working
in an office?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Yep. Pretty much.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
So what's a hotel run you
these days?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I ain't tellin' ya that! It's a
secret!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
C'mon, you can tell me.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000206><n 0>
I said no! Ya don't just start
askin' 'bout other people's
cash flow! Ain't right!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
How long you been running
the place?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
'Bout five years now.


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I'd been thinkin' 'bout startin' 
up a business when I saw
this hotel for sale.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Place was goin' for a song,
so I bit.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Talk about a sucker! Shoulda  
just buried my cash in a
damn hole...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I thought a hotel'd be a
perfect way t'make some
quick scratch.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
'Course, after openin', I did
nothin' but break my back
every damn day!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
Can't tell ya how many times
I thought 'bout hightailin' it
back to my <color red>old job<color white>...
<sprite 0000125><color red>What did Dunning used to do?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>

By the way, Mr. Angel in 213

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00002FF><n 0>
Told me that whole mess'a
his is taken care of.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00002FF><n 0>
Found his missin' stuff in his 
own room. Just where I told
him it was!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000109><n 0>
Maybe you could quit this
gig and go tell fortunes.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000205><n 0>
Don't I know it! Last thing

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000120><n 0>
This is a bottle of rosé.


<sprite 0000125><color red>Who had rosé?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
Was this the wine Helen

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Nope, this isn't Helen's wine.
