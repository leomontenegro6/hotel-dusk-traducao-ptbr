There's a wine bottle next
to the microwave.

Hmmm...red wine. I bet this
is the bottle Helen ordered.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000119><n 0>
Looks like there's still a bit
of wine in the bottom of
the bottle.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I don't need the whole bottle. 
Just the label.
