You're still cleaning?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
Oh, yes! Clean, clean, clean!
That's all poor Rosa does!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
This old hotel's about to fall
apart, you know?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Sometimes I think I'm the
only thing that keeps it
going...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
Besides, the key to good
housekeeping is sticking 
with it. Can't let dirt win!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Guess not.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
So where were you? Huh?
Did you stop by the bar?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Yeah.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Oh! And how was it?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000109><n 0>
Not bad.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
That's good to hear!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Dunning decided to let Louis
manage the bar all by his
lonesome!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
That boy! When it comes to
cleaning, he just wants to
loaf, but he loves that bar!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Seems so.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Well, that's Louis for you.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
I wish he would put the same
effort into helping me! But
will he? Land sakes, no!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
How long has that bar been 
here?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
Oh, quite a while now!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
I heard it was opened to
celebrate the <color red>hotel's tenth<color white>
<color red>anniversary<color white>.
<sprite 0000125><color red>When was the anniversary?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Mmm-hmm! Me? I think it's too 
small, but folks seem to be
taken with it anyway.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
It's always full! And the folks
there always leave me a
terrible mess!
!------------------------------------------------------!
<r 126_R>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So when was the tenth
anniversary?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000302><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Well, let's see... The hotel was
built twenty years ago... That
was 1959, so...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
1969! If my math is right, and
I just know it is!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Ten years ago...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
<color blue>Wait a second...<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>That incident with the missing <color white>
<color blue>kid happened about ten years <color white>
<color blue>ago.<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So I heard about a strange
incident that went down
ten years ago. 
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You know anything about
that?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000307><n 0>
Oh...


<sprite 0000125><color red>So something did happen.<color white>
!------------------------------------------------------!
<r 126_R>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So the story's true?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000302><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
So you heard, did you? I can
just guess who told you!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Little bird.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
I just bet! Well, I'm a terrible
liar, so I guess I can't
pretend not to know!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
So it's true?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
...Yes, Mr. Hyde, it's true.
Every word.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000114><n 0>
That's interesting.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
...HA! Oh, Rosa fooled you 
but good! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hyde!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
What?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
Oh, you should have seen
your face... Whew! No, I'm
afraid it's just a rumor.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
But when I started here? I
thought it was true, too,
and for a fact!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Rosa... You made a joke.
Did it hurt?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Oh, hush now!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Anyway, when I first asked
Dunning if it was true, he
flat out laughed at me!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
And here I was, hoping to get
a peek at a ghost! What
silliness!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
That's one word for it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Dunning says that this kind
of thing happens all the
time!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
What with hotels changing
owners and closing down
and so forth? 
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
Well, rumors get started and
folks talk about ghosts and
murders and there you go!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Writing something, Mr. Hyde?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>

I'll get out of your hair.

Oh, but, Mr. Hyde! Maybe you
want to hear more about
this hotel's history? Hmm?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Well, if I were you, I'd ask
Dunning himself! Yes I
would!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
I'm sure the old coot is
around somewhere!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>

Just listen! It's about the
restaurant!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
See, sometimes when our
guests order wine, they
like to keep the labels.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Well, when that happens, we 
always deliver it to their
room later.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
But I'm as busy as can be,
and Louis has to run that
darn bar of his!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
And so neither of us can
spare the time to do it!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
And then when I saw you,
I thought...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You thought I'd do it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Oh, aren't you sharp! Yes,
that's my thought. Exactly!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I do this, and you're just going
to give me a dustpan.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
Hush! I will not! And I'll give
you a free breakfast to

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
...Keep talking.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
We've got fresh blueberry

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
...Fine. Who wants the damn
label?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Language! ...And the label
goes to Mrs. Parker up
in Room 212.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
<color blue>The old woman...<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>

It's quite a touching story,

So tonight, the poor woman
ordered that very same
bottle of wine!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
I didn't want to snoop, but
I watched her drink it, and
she looked so sad...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Well, when she finished, she
started talking about this
and that...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>

Rosa the Wonder Maid and her

You're not proud of him?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
It's not that, Mr. Hyde. It's

Well, you're a pretty complex

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Do you know what he said

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
He told me to QUIT MY JOB!
Can you imagine?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
"Come to Manhattan!" he says!
