Better get that.

Hey, doll.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
So what's new?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Tied up that twenty-thousand
dollar problem I mentioned
earlier.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
I wish I had time to hear all

Let me put him on.

...Hyde! It's Ed! What's the

<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Louie and me had a little 
chat about his pal Danny.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
I'm listening.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Louie wasn't involved in the
murder. And he didn't make
off with the cash, either.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Yeah? So who iced him?


<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
...Bradley.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
What?!


<b 0168>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Seems Bradley was working for 
Nile under the name of J.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
J? That's a helluva'n alias.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Louie and Danny had a meet
scheduled, but Bradley
crashed the party.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Well, I'll be damned.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
He blew Danny away, then 
took a painting the kid had
swiped from Nile's hideout.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Bradley also got the money
Danny was using to close
the deal. ...Nile's money.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
This was three years back.
Right before I met Bradley
on the docks.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
At least, that's Louie's story.
For what it's worth, I think
he's playing me straight.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Makes sense. Keep talkin'.


<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I told Louie I was still on the
hunt for Bradley.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
He put two and two together
and told me everything.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Now he wants to help out.
Keeps saying we're partners.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Har! Revenge makes strange
bedfellows.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah, there's more.


<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
When I checked in, I heard
a guy with my name had
stayed here.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Happened about six months
back.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Anyway, I searched the room
the guy stayed in and found
a lighter.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Oh yeah?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah, and it's a lighter I
remember well, if you follow.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You telling me Bradley
stayed at that hotel?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
That what you're thinking?


<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Could be.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Uh-huh...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You thinking you can pick
up his trail?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Worse things could happen.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Tell me something, Hyde. Why 
you still chasing this ghost?

<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
He's no ghost.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You hate him. That it?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Ed, I...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Hell, I understand. Bradley
was your partner. Your
friend.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
One day he double-crosses
you, and the world gets a
little bit colder.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
So you trail him to the docks 
and give him the lead kiss.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
That's notµ


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
And when his mug don't turn 
up with all the other floaters
in the Hudson...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You go after him again. Even
losin' the badge can't stop
you.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Hate like that eats a man
alive.

<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
It isn't hate, Ed. Never was.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I just need to know why he
did what he did.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Why he sold me out.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Bradley had a reason.
I know it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
So you say.


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Ed?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
...Yeah?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I didn't expect much when
you sent me to this hole.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
But what I've found tonight 
with Louie. And Bradley...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
You still think it's coincidence?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
'Course it is!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
The hell else could it be?


<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah, maybe...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Hey, I heard you been putting
Rachel through the paces.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Having her run research on
some dead art mope?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
What's the story?


<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
One of the guests keeps
talking about a painting.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Thing's called Angel Opening a
Door. Supposed to be worth
a fortune.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Rachel says it was pinched
from an art museum three
years ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Lemme guess... You think it's
the painting Bradley nicked.

<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Just a hunch.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
A hunch, huh? Been a long
time since I heard you say
that.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Your little DeNonno reunion
get the cop instincts flowing
again?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
It's not like that. I just...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You just what?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I know this sounds nuts, but
I don't care.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
There's something about this
place, Ed. I know it.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Something here is going to
lead me to Bradley.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Huh...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You really believe that?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah. I do.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
OK, Hyde. I'll give you one
last night to follow this.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
But if nothing shakes loose
tonight, it's time to hang
it up.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
I ain't gonna watch this thing 
ruin your damn life.

<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I don't have much of a life
to ruin, Ed.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
All right, enough'a this crap.
Let's talk business.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Remember those items I asked 
you to find?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Well, I may need you to hand 
'em over to the client
directly.
<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
