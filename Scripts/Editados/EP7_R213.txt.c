Your dad back?

Not yet.

I'll tell him to come to your

Can I help you?

Something I wanted to ask
you.

...Fine.

You know anybody runs a
gallery down in Santa Monica?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
That's a rather odd question,
isn't it?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You were talking about a
gallery at the bar.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
While you were drinking with
Kevin Woodward? Remember?
Guy from Room 219?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I remember my actions quite
well, thank you. I didn't black
out or anything.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
And what business is this of
yours?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Just curious.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
Do you want me to believe
that you've suddenly become
a patron of the arts?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Yeah, that's me. I'm a big fan
of apple paintings and armless
statues.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000906><n 0>
Hmph!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000901><n 0>
If you must know, I merely
mentioned a gallery where an
associate of mine works.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000901><n 0>
Mr. Woodward then told me,
with no prompting from me,
that he <color red>knew of it<color white>.
<sprite 0000125><color red>Woodward knew the gallery?<color white>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000901><n 0>
Actually, I... I'm glad you're
here. I need to speak with
you about something.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000901><n 0>
Believe it or not, I don't have 
anyone else to turn to for
help.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Oh, I believe it.

Sorry about earlier. I got a bit
carried away.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Talk to me. I promise to  
close my head and listen.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000906><n 0>
...Very well.
