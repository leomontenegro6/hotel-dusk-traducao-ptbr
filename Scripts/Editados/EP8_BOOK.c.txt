After I ask Ed to look into
Robert Evans and Gallery
May, I find Iris's stolen
envelope in a utility closet
trash can. I also find a
cassette tape that was in
the envelope.
I borrow Louie's cassette
deck and listen to the
tape. It's some sort of 
shady deal recorded on
the sly. I don't know why
Iris has this, and I decide
to press the dame for 
more details.
I press the right buttons
and Iris comes clean. She 
tells me that Grace sent
her the tape and told her
to come to Hotel Dusk if
she didn't hear from her
by Christmas.
Seems Iris and Grace are
sisters who were separated
when they were still kids. 
Now Grace is on the lam,
and Iris is looking for her.
Apparently, she's supposed
to give the tape to a man
who painted the angel.
Louie and I have an 
impromptu bowling match, 
and he ends up breaking
a potted plant. But that 
turns into a piece of good
news, because we find the
wine cellar key inside.
Rosa hears about Mila's
missing father, and thinks
it's Dunning. She tells Mila 
she knows her father, but
turns out she's wrong.
Her mistake reveals that 
Dunning has a daughter of
his own.
After all that, Ed rings up
and lets me know that
Robert Evans closed up
Gallery May seven years
ago and vanished off the
face of the earth.
