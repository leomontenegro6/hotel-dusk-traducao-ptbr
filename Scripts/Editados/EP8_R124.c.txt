<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
What are you looking at?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
This is the brochure that Mila
had.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
It's a hotel brochure from ten
years ago.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Well, if it's really just so you
can help Mila... I guess I can
tell you.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
I like you, Mr. Hyde. And I
do trust you, I guess.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I like you too, Rosa.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
But you have to swear that
you'll look for her father!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
You told her you would, so
you have to promise!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I will.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Well, you see... It's about the
old brochure that Mila was
carrying.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
I knew as soon as I saw it.
I knew...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
I had seen it before.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Where?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
In Mr. Smith's room.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
His office?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
No, his personal quarters. He
normally won't let anyone
go in there!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
But he's such a lazy man,
and he asked me to clean
it once or twice.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
And anyway, that's how I saw 
the brochure.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
And once I saw that Mila had
the same one, it all became
clear as day!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
You want to fill me in?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
The poor girl must have been 
here a long time ago!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Why do you think that?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Because Dunning told me so,
that's why!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
...See, he only became the
owner of this place some
five years ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
And that brochure is much
older than that, which made
me curious.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
So I asked him about it a
little while back. About
where he got it.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
And he told me.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
He said he had stayed here
once with his family a long
time ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
And that's how he got the
brochure.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Wait... Dunning has a family?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Well, I can't be sure about 
the details. He won't talk
much about himself.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
But last year I told him a
bit about my husband.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
And then he talked about
his family.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
What did he tell you?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
He has a daughter.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
But I think she lives pretty
far away.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
A daughter...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
So that picture...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
That's right. I pretended not
to know anything when you
brought it up.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
But I think the girl in that
picture is his daughter.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
But something happened that
has kept them apart for quite
some time.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
So when I figured out that
Mila was looking for
someone...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
I instantly thought about
Mr. Smith.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
That's why you told Mila that
you knew her father?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
That's right! Oh, it just felt
so perfect!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
But Mila just looked so sad, 
and then she left!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I see.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, you don't suppose
that Dunning really isµ

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
No. He's not.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000307><n 0>
Oh, dear...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Mila's father is a gallery owner
named Robert Evans.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
Oh, but I... I was so sure...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000308><n 0>
Oh, heavens.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
I opened my big mouth and
spoke without knowing! 
That poor girl...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Don't beat yourself up about
it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
How can I not?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
I mean... I... She...


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00003FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
Well, now I'm just all kinds
of confused!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Why?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
About Dunning!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
I thought that was why he 
was upset when I took
Mila in!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
And why he wouldn't get
anywhere near her!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
So I guess...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
There must be something
between them. Just not
what I thought...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Maybe so.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
You know what Mr. Smith
said to me?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
He said, "You take her to the 
police first thing in the
morning!"
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
And when I asked him if that 
was really the best thing to
do?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
He couldn't even look me
in the eye!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, I'm just like you.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
I just want to help this poor
girl. I'll do whatever I can.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
But you have to help her!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
I will.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00003FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
<m 007>But I need to know one
more thing.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Is there a painting of an angel
in this hotel?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
An angel?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Yeah. Wings, halo, little clouds.
Angel.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
No, not that I know of.


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000114><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
But we do have lots of 
apple paintings!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Yeah, I noticed that.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
Land sakes, those things are
everywhere! Pictures of 
apples all over the hotel!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
Now, why anyone would need
that many apple paintings
is beyond me...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Rosa, I don't care about
apples. I care about the
angel.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Well, we don't have one.
At least, I've never seen
it.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Just apples.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
<color blue>Again with the stupid apples.<color white>
<color blue>Can't sneeze without hitting<color white>
<color blue>one of those.<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
