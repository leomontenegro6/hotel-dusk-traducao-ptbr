What do you want to know?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Give me the skinny on the
tape.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
The tape is none of your
concern.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
Just give it back.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You want the tape? I want
answers.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Who are the voices on the
tape?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000913><n 0>
I have no idea.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
No idea? You really do think
I'm an idiot, don't you?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Where does a princess like
you get something like this?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
I told you.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
Grace sent it to me.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
<color red>She asked me to bring it<color white>
<color red>here.<color white> That's all.

<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>This was a favor?<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Hold it.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00009FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Bring what here?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
<e 41>Do they not have subtlety 
where you come from,
Mr. Hyde?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
The tape. The one that you
refuse to return to me.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Why'd you bring it here?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
Because I was TOLD TO!


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000913><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Grace gave you the tape.
What was the plan?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She told me to wait for her
to contact me again.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
If I didn't hear from her by
Christmas, I was to bring
the tape to this hotel.
<sprite 0000125><color red>Why would Grace want that?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
I can't tell you any more,
Mr. Hyde.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
That is everything I know
about this whole affair.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You and Grace were close?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
That's right.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
So you must know all about
her, right? About her 
family?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That why you were boozing
it up with her husband,
Kevin Woodward?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000907><n 0>
<color red>Her... Her HUSBAND?<color white>


<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>That got her.<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Well?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00009FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Cut the crap. I doubt you
were with the guy for his
sparkling conversation.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
<e 41>I...I had no idea. You must
believe me.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
I can't believe this is true...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Guess you didn't know.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
Are you sure?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
That man is Grace's...husband?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
Then that little girl...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
The girl in the restaurant
is...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Yeah. That's her kid.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
Oh...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
Now I understand why she 
had that<color red> doll <color white>with her.

<sprite 0000125><color red>You know about the doll?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Fill me in.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I got questions and I'm
running out of time.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000913><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
When did you last see Grace?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000914><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Where is she now?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00009FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000116><n 0>
Talk, dammit!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000116><n 0>
Where is Grace! Where has
she gone?!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
You stupid, insensitive FOOL!
I don't know, all right?
I DON'T KNOW!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
And YOU are the one who
should be telling ME what's
going on!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
...Wait, I don'tµ


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
I'm the one who knows her,
you idiot! I'm the one who's
SEARCHING for her!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
I HAVE to find her! There's
<color red>something I have to ask<color white>
<color red>her<color white>!
<sprite 0000125><color red>What's she going to ask?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I think I know why Grace
asked you to do this.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000914><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
And why she wanted the tape
brought here.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00009FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I think she plans to pick it
up here.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
<e 41>...What?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
I don't think that's true.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That tape is insurance. She
needs it to give someone
the strong-arm.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000907><n 0>
...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I guessed right, huh?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
I don't know what the tape 
is for.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
When Grace sent me the
tape, she gave me a
message.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
If I didn't hear from her by
Christmas, I was to come
to this pathetic hotel.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
And I had to bring the tape
with me.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
I'm supposed to hand it
over to a certain <color red>man<color white>.

<sprite 0000125><color red>And who would that be?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Melissa's doll caught your
eye, huh?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What's going on there?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00009FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You're going to steal it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
<e 41>Don't be absurd!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
You're wrong!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You've seen that doll before
tonight, right?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000903><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
After all, Grace is the one
who made it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
I didn't... I didn't know she
made it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
That explains why it looks so
much like <color red>our dolls<color white>.

<sprite 0000125><color red>...Our dolls? <color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I figured it out.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I think I know why you're
looking for Grace.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00009FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You were going to ask her
about Kevin.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
<e 41>You really are an idiot.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I told you, I only met him
tonight. I couldn't possibly
ask her about him.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You're trying to track her
down.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
Yes.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
I thought she was married
and...happy. You know?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
I refuse to believe that she
just vanished for no reason!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Woodward got hit with a big
lawsuit back in '77. He was
about to lose everything.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Grace raised a whole bunch
of dough and pulled his ass
out of the fire.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000907><n 0>
But how?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Good question. If you find
out, tell Kevin, will ya?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Apparently, Grace refused to
tell him where she got the
cash.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Guy couldn't take it. They
fought about the cash and
he stopped trusting her.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Then she decides to skip
town. 

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
Oh, Grace...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
This isn't some tape Grace
picked up at a yard sale.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What's the story? What
does it mean?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
I don't know.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Kevin got sued for a king's
ransom. Where'd Grace get
the money to pay that off?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
I don't know! OK? I don't
have any idea.

<sprite 0000125><color red>I bet it was dirty money.<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Who gets the tape?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
I don't know.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Nice plan.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
I asked her. Grace, I mean.
I asked her who she meant.
But...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
She just told me to give it
to the man who painted
the angel.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
I hoped that I'd understand
when I got here, but I
don't.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
<s 4003010>The angel, huh?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
So here I am. A girl with no
plan, trapped in the worst
hotel in the world.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
I'm lost, Mr. Hyde. I have no
idea who this man is or
how to find him.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
How did Grace pull together
that much scratch?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
I have no idea.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You have one of those
dolls, too?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
I've seen that doll before.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
Maybe not that exact one,
but...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
It looks just like the dolls 
Grace and I used to have
when we were kids.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
Did I say something worth
writing down, Mr. Hyde?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
Big reader, hmm?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
It was in the envelope.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
Grace put the tape in there
and sent it to me.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000907><n 0>
Oh!


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>

I doubt you're the kind of

from, anyway...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
This about the tape?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
No. ...It's about Grace.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
Well, about Grace and me,
actually.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
What's the story?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
I'm her little sister.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
<s 4004010>No kidding.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
<m 014>She's four years older than
I am.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
...I didn't see that coming.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Our mother was a kind,
beautiful woman, but 
she was weak.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Terrified of being alone, easily
manipulated, terribly sad. I'm 
sure you know the type. 
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She fell in love so easily, 
and always with the wrong
kind of man.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
They used her and hurt her
and left her... And then she
would just find another one.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
We lived on the run. Running
away from the last bad man
and toward the next.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
And every time we moved,
we got a new father.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
In truth, Grace and I are
only half sisters. I don't
even remember her father.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
But it didn't matter. Growing
up, we were inseparable.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
When you're always the new
kid, you hang on to what
you have.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
We were best friends.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
But then my mother died,
and Grace and I were
separated...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I thought I would die as well.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Your mom died young?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Yes, in a plane crash.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Do you remember that Las
Vegas plane crash in 1960?
She was on it.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I was nine years old, and far
too young to understand.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She was just...gone. 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
The man she was with at
the time was a pathetic
snake.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
The airline gave Grace and
me a large sum of money,
and he took it all.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Once that was done, he
stashed us in separate 
orphanages and vanished.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Grace and I, we... We lost
contact.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I was eventually adopted, but
I didn't care much for my
new parents.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
At fifteen, I ran away and
spent five years in a blur
of hotels and highways...
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
When I was twenty, I found
work at some run-down
diner in Santa Monica.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
And one day, Grace walked
back into my life.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
It's funny. I knew her right
away, but she... She didn't
know me at first.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I guess those five years
changed me more than
I thought.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Anyway, after a few moments,
she recognized me and we
were reunited.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She was so beautiful, Mr. 
Hyde. Just...beautiful.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She had gone to college
and made something of
herself.
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She was working as a
curator at a place called
Gallery May.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
And she was engaged to
a doctor.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
We promised to meet up
later, but instead I quit
and fled Santa Monica.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I heard Grace was looking
for me, but I never tried
to contact her.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Why's that?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Because I was ashamed,
Mr. Hyde. She was radiant,
and I was...pathetic.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I didn't want her to see
me like that, and so I
ran away. ...Again.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I decided to follow my dream 
of becoming an actress.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I jumped from city to city,
taking any role that was
thrown my way.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
And in that fashion, time
just...passed. 

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
But two years ago, Grace
tracked me down.

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
<m 021>I had just been featured

Grace saw it and tracked me
down through the agency.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I was shocked by what she
had become. The girl from
Santa Monica was gone.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Her eyes, Mr. Hyde. Her
eyes were so sad...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She waited until we were 
alone and then broke
down.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She told me she needed
money. She begged me 
to help her.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
And did you?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, I could have sold
my entire life and not come
close to what she needed.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
And she wouldn't even tell
me what it was for!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I told her no. I had no choice,
I... I couldn't dream of getting
that kind of money.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
She was sobbing, Mr. Hyde. 
Sobbing and apologizing
and...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
She told me she was sorry
for asking the impossible.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
And that she didn't really care
about the money. She just
wanted to see me.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
She said it gave her the
courage to do what must
be done. ...For her family.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
It was like we were little
girls all over again.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
How so?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00009FF><n 0>
<m 007>We were still so young...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
We moved from place to
place, and I spent all my
time in the car, sobbing.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
Mom was too caught up with 
her men to do more than
scold me.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
But Grace was my savior. She 
used to put my favorite doll
between her arms.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
Then she would hold me and
talk to me until I calmed
down.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
I thought back to that after
she left the agency.

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
After a few seconds, I 
decided to chase her 
down.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
But when I ran out the
door, she... She was gone.

The envelope arrived about
a year and a half after that.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
It contained a letter and
that cassette tape.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
I don't have the letter, but
I read it again and again
and remember every word.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
"Iris, my family desperately 
needed money, and I did
a terrible thing."
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
"If you don't hear from me
by Christmas, I need you to
do something for me."
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
"Take this tape to Hotel 
Dusk."

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
The letter went on to tell
me to give the tape to the
man who painted the angel.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
So! Here I am. What a
fantastic Christmas this
is turning out to be...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Anyway, that's all I know,
Mr. Hyde. 

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
The tape is a mystery.
The letter is a mystery.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I was scared when that 
tape went missing, but I
guess it doesn't matter.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
None of it tells me how
to find this man who
paints angels.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
I hoped that coming here
would clear everything up,
but it didn't.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000911><n 0>
I'm clueless, Mr. Hyde.
Clueless and frustrated and
just plain tired of it all.

Kevin's been looking for
Grace for a long time.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And Melissa's getting pretty
desperate, too.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Guess we can add you to
the mix.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000914><n 0>
I just want to see her again.
I want to know that she's
all right.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Don't worry. We still got
hope.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
We know the guy who made
the angel painting is here.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And I'm going to look for
him.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
If I find him, I bet I'll find 
Grace, too.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000907><n 0>
...Mr. Hyde.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Maybe that'll make your
Christmas a little better.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'll be around. Grab me if you
think of anything else.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000121><n 0>
And here's your tape back.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
...Mr. Hyde.

What?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
Your intuition is awful, and 
you haven't understood a
single thing I said.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
...Oh.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
You think you're bright and
clever, but I don't think
it's true.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
Please, I... I don't want to
talk to you anymore.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
<e 07>Just go.

Hyde went into his room and
didn't come out until
the next morning...
