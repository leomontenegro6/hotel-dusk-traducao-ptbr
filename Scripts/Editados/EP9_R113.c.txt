Have you learned anything
about Mila's father? Huh?
Well, have you?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Rosa, it's been about twenty
minutes. I'm good, but not
that good.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
Oh! Oh, yes, I suppose not.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
Well, I guess you'll just have
to put on your sleuthing 
cap!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
But I may have one thing.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
Yes?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Mila's father is a guy named 
Robert Evans.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Robert Evans?
Robert Evans!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Oh my goodness! Oh my
stars!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Easy, Rosa. 


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I take it you've heard of
him?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
No, I'm just excited.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Oh.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
So your father's name is
Robert Evans, is it, Mila?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000503><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
I wonder where he could be.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000513><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
Never you fret, Mila honey!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
Mr. Hyde is going to find him
for you!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Right, Mr. Hyde?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Sure...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Listen, where are those apple
paintings you were talking
about?
<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000302><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You said there were five,
right?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
That's right.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Are there really five?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
For a fact!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
This hotel isn't that big, you
know! And I've counted
them many times!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Those paintings have been
here as long as I have.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
I guess you saw how each
painting has a different
number of apples?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Well, I was sure that had
some kind of meaning, but
darned if I know it!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
I tried asking Mr. Smith about
it once, but that man is
just useless.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
"Who knows," he told me. 
I bet HE knows, the old
coot!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I don't know about that, but
I did learn something else.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000307><n 0>
Truly? Oooo! Tell Rosa!
Come on now!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
There's a hidden letter in
each painting.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Letters? Goodness, me!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I think those letters mean
something.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That's why I need to know
where all the paintings are
hung.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000303><n 0>
I see.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Well, there are three on the
second floor and two on the
first floor. Right?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Wait, there are TWO on the
first floor?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Of course! There's the one
in the hallway and then...
Oh, but you wouldn't know...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
You wouldn't know about the
one in the <color red>special room<color white>!

<sprite 0000125><color red>What's the special room?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
OK, I'm curious. What's the
special room?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000302><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
It's at the back of the lobby.
It's the only room like it
in the entire hotel.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
And that's where the fifth
painting is?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
That's right! It says Room 111
on the door.

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000124><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
What are you writing?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
What are you looking at?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Can you get me into
Room 111?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000302><n 0>
<e 28>


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
So you can see the apple 
painting. Is that it?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Well... I suppose so. All right.
But only for Mila!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Oh, and because I'm a little
bit curious, too!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Thanks.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
I'm going to have to sneak
the key away from Mr. Smith! 

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Once I do that, I'll go into
Room 111 and wait for you.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Then you can just slip in
later. OK? Good!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Got it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Mila is counting on you to
figure this all out! So don't
mess it up!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
And for mercy's sake, don't
let Dunning know about
any of this! Sneak around!

<s 1012010>Rosa sneaks off down the

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
<color blue>Now what? Should I ask Mila<color white>
<color blue>about her old man?<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Mila...


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000503><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
All right, all right. Don't look
at me like that.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000502><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
<color blue>I'll just wait until I know what's <color white>
<color blue>what with those paintings.<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You coming along for the
ride?
