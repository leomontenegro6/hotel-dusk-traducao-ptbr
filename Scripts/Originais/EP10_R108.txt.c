Must be. Being dead

Thank goodness! I'm so glad

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
But I got a knot on my

You and me both.

I'm glad that's all it is!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
To come in here and find

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
I near to fainted clean away! 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
What on earth happened?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000411><n 0>
We got thumped good. Some
dirtbag hit us from behind.
Yeah, Hyde?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
That's my take on it. I walked 
in here and saw Louie on the 
floor.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000108><n 0>
When I went to check on
him...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Somebody dry-gulched me.
Never saw it coming.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Who would do such a thing?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Didn't see a face.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
How 'bout you, Louie? You

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Naw, man. All I saw was stars
and the floor.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
I was checkin' out the shelves
in the cellar when I got
whacked.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000411><n 0>
Oww...can't believe how much
this hurts, man!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000108><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
That's enough whining from

<m 160>Mr. Hyde, Mila hasn't come
back yet!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
She's still gone?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
Yes! And I'm as worried as
can be!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
I can't believe any of this.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
Just when the girl starts to
talk, she up and vanishes!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
<m 021>Whoa! Hold up, Mama Sass.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Mila started talkin'? When this
happen?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
I ain't heard squat 'bout that!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000313><n 0>
I just haven't spoken to you
about it yet, Louis DeNonno!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
...Same ol' song and dance.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
No one tells Louie nothin'.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
So when did Mila start talkin'?
...And did she say anything
about me? Huh?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Focus, Louie. 


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
We were in Room 111. Rosa
opened it so I could eyeball 
an apple painting.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Apple painting? The one what
you been lookin' for?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That's it.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
There are five of them in 
this joint.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And each one's got a
different letter of the
alphabet in it.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
String all five of them
together and they spell
out a name.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Jenny.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Jenny? I don't know no Jenny! 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000308><n 0>
Jenny? That's...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
But that's the name of the
girl Mila was talking about!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah. It is.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I just 
got cracked upside the head, 
remember?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Did Mila start talkin' while you 
was looking at the painting?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
No. It was after.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I came out of the room and 
she had keeled over.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
What? She, like, fainted?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
For a fact! Poor thing lost
consciousness, and then
stopped breathing!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
Oh man...trip...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
But Mr. Hyde gave her mouth-
to-mouth and saved her life!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Mouth-to-mouth? Hyde?
Oh, man, talk to me, 
brother!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
You're an idiot, Louie.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000305><n 0>
Once Mila came around, she
started talking. And that's all
there is to that!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I think Room 111 triggered
something. 

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
What's that?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
She remembered coming to 
the Dusk ten years ago
with her father.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
You think that's true?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Sounds like she was playing 
in 111 with this Jenny kid.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Then somebody up and
snatches the kid right
in front of her.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Aw, get outta here! 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
I took Mila back to my room,
and Mr. Smith showed up.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
He told me to take Mila to the
police in the morning.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Well, I told him that Mila could
talk, and that we didn't need
the police's help.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Mr. Dunning's eyes got as wide
as hotcakes, and he said he
had to talk to her!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Wait, so he took Mila? Man,
this is trippy.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But I think I follow you so
far...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
There's more.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Kevin Woodward knows Mila.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Melissa's pops?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Woodward's a doctor down at
Robbins Memorial Hospital.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Mila was a patient there for a
long time.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
You did NOT tell me any of
this, Mr. Hyde! Is the poor
girl sick?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Not exactly. She was in a
coma for ten years.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000308><n 0>
Oh my stars...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Then six months ago, she
wakes up. Woodward says
it was a total surprise.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Man...now my melon's really
achin'. You can't make up 
crap this weird.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Lemme make sure I follow...
Mila was here ten years
ago, yeah? I dig that.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But then she goes under for
ten years? That's crazy.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
It gets crazier.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Woodward told me Mila's old
man used to visit her once
a month.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Nice guy, right? But right
before she opens her eyes
and rejoins the world?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Her old man vanishes. No
one's heard from him.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Oh, that poor man!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
It's possible he doesn't even
know that she recovered.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Possible.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000312><n 0>
And that's why Mila's trying to
find him.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yo, Hyde, you sure WE ain't
still knocked out? This is the 
freakiest story I ever heard.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Better sit down then, Louie,
'cause I ain't done.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Right before Mila came around,
she got a new visitor.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Wasn't her old man, either.
It was somebody using the
name Kyle Hyde.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
All right, that's enough! You
gotta be kiddin' me, right?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
'Cause if that's true, then
you-know-who was at the 
hospital!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
I know.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000407><n 0>
Whole thing blows my mind,
man...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, I'm awfully worried
about Mila!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
We have to hurry and find
where she and Mr. Smith
have gotten to.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Yeah, I know.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
But we also have to check 
out this wine cellar.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
There's a whiskey bottle on
top of the shelf.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
This whiskey...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
It's the same stuff that was

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>

What's wrong?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
Something about that whiskey
bottle seems odd to me.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Huh? Like what?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
It's just a whiskey bottle. Not
a thing odd about it. Trust me
on this one, I know whiskey.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000304><n 0>
Spare me your expertise, 
Louis! If I say something's 
odd, it's odd!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
Why is there a half-full bottle
of whiskey in the wine cellar?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
If you're going to open a
bottle, why wouldn't you put
it in the bar?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Wait a... LOUIS! Have you been
down here drinking on the
sly?!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
What? C'mon, Mama Sass,
gimme a break!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
I run the bar! If I wanna drink,
I'll pound 'em down up there!

You'll do what I tell you to do,
and I'm telling you to wait
here.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
Gimme one good reason!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I need backup. I don't know
what's down there.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
If something happens, you're
going to have to come haul
my ass out of the fire.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
I'll see that he stays put,
Mr. Hyde.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
If you're not back in an hour,
I'll send Louis after you. For
what good that'll do...
