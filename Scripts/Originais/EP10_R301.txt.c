101 uses for pencil lead?
This is the dumbest book
ever...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
"Pencil lead is great! And it's

clay. But it's still great!"
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
"It can be used to lubricate
and increase the conductivity 
of electrical contacts!"
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
"Just grind the pencil lead 
into powder and sprinkle it
on electrical contact points!"
