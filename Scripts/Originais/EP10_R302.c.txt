<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Yeah... Dunning.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Huh? You tryin' to tell me ol'

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
You're trippin', Hyde!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Dunning's the one who painted
all the apples, Louie.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
I think the fumes is gettin' to
me. I thought you said 
Dunning painted apples.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You heard right. Now keep
listening.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Dunning's got a daughter he
hasn't seen in years. Her
name's Jenny.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Jenny?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That's the name of the girl
who was kidnapped from
Room 111 ten years ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah, and it's the name what 
them apple painting letters 
spell out, too.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah. But here's something I
learned in the basement.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Dunning knew Evans before
he took over this hotel.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Wait... Evans? That's Mila's
pops, yeah?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
You sure 'bout all this? Hard
to believe Dunning and Mila's
pops were pals.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'm sure.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
They knew each other, and
they shared a secret they'd
die before revealing.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
That's a heavy secret, man.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But you know it, yeah? C'mon,
brother, lemme hear it!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You know the angel painting
Bradley stole from Nile's
warehouse?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Dunning painted it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
WHAT?!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
You're crazy! That don't make
no damn sense!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Listen, Louie.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
The proof is in this room.
I'm sure of it.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Help me find it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
It's a huge sheet of canvas.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
One side of the canvas is
covered in white paint.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>

It's a well-used palette and

Palette knife? Is that it?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
An angel...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You ever see this painting

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>

Yo, Hyde! Is...is that it?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
One and the same, Louie.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
This is the angel painting
Bradley stole from Nile.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
I need a drink, man. Hell, I 
need three.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
But what... How... What's it
doin' here?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
It's like I said. THIS angel
painting was created by
Dunning.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah, but... How ya expect me
to believe that?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Hey, Louie, you know the
name of this painting?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Ain't it Angel Painting?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
That's what Danny always
called it.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
No offense to Danny, but it's
called Angel Opening a Door.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Angel Opening a Door?
Sure, why not?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
If I gotta buy that ol' man
Dunning painted it, I can
believe anything.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You're getting loopy on me,
Louie. Now listen.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The rest of the world thinks
this was painted by a guy
named Osterzone.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Osterzone was an artist born 
in the nineteenth century.
Or so the story goes.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Couple dozen or so of his
paintings were discovered
forty years after he died.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And then all the artsy types
went gaga over 'em.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Angel Opening a Door is
supposed to have been his
masterpiece.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
So, wait. This Osterzone cat
really did do an angel painting?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
And then Dunning, like,
copied it?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
This isn't a copy, Louie.
This is the original.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
The original? But...I... That
can't be right.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
You said this painting is one'a 
Ostertoes... Er... Oserman... 
Ozzie... Whatever! 
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Still don't get it?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Get WHAT?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
<s 4004010>Dunning IS Osterzone!


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
...Oh, trip...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
<m 021>This is like findin' out your
girl's your sister or somethin'.
It's messed up.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Three years back, my pal
Danny got plugged over this
painting!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Thought he could sell it and
get enough scratch for us 
to break outta the city.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
And...and here it is.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
In some secret vault under 
my damn bedroom, a million
miles from New York!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
This blows my mind.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
...Why?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
WHY?!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
The HELL is it doing here?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Louieµ


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
Don't Louie me, man!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
Tell me!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
You want to know how it
got here?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I think Bradley returned it
to the man who painted it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
What? Bradley RETURNED it?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
What's that supposed to mean?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
I think Bradley knew the
truth about Osterzone.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Aw, you're killin' me, Hyde.


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
He knew Osterzone was just
a painter somebody made up.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Wait, but you saidµ


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Look, Osterzone's story is that
he was a painter who died
before his work was valued.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Truth is, no one ever heard 
of the guy at all.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Not until somebody wrote
a book about him.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Thanks to the book, he went 
from nobody to somebody 
overnight.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
And his paintings started 
selling for a whole lot
of dough.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
What kinda book is it?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
It's called "Osterzone, the
Phantom Painter."

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
It was published in 1963. You
know who wrote it?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Robert Evans.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Robert Evans?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
That's Mila's pops, ain't it?
But that means...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
OK, OK. I think I follow.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
So Mila's pops is part of this
whole angel painting thing, too?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah. This angel's one popular 
dame. Got herself a whole
flock of admirers.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The thing I haven't figured
out yet is why.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Why did Evans and Dunning
create Osterzone in the
first place?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And how did Bradley stumble
onto it?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
More mysteries? You know,
I used to like mysteries. Not
anymore, man.
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000141><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
You got it figured out?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
<m 014>Not all of it, but I think I'm
getting close. I've just got
to line everything up.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
Here's what I got so far.
Evans's book on Osterzone
came out sixteen years ago.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
Then Mila and her old man
came here ten years ago.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah, that's when the hotel
closed up for a bit.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
And the story about the girl
going missing from the hotel?
Ten years ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Oh! Oh! And that's when Mila
went into a coma and got
put in the hospital!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
And it's when Mila's old man
bought the hotel. A lot
happened ten years back.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Wait, wait.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Mila's pops used to own the
Dusk?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Yeah.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Robert Evans used to be the
owner.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
But seven years ago, he
suddenly closes up his art
gallery and disappears.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
And then Dunning buys the
hotel.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Hold it. Woodward said Mila's
pops always came to see her
in the hospital.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
And he only stopped comin'
six months ago, yeah?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
That's what he said.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000411><n 0>
It don't add up, man.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
When did Dunning reopen the
Dusk? Five years ago, right?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah, and Bradley killed Danny
three years ago.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Then you went and shot
Bradley right after.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>

How don't you know?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I heard what he did. Heard he

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I finally caught up to him at
the docks.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
I was mad as hell, Louie. I
could barely see.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I pulled my piece and yelled
at him. Asked him why he 
did it...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
So what'd he say?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000114><n 0>
Nothing... Not a word. Just
turned and looked at me.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
There was a message there, 
but I couldn't read it. It
was all too fast.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Then he turned, and I  
thought he was going to
make a run for it.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I... My gun was out, and I...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
