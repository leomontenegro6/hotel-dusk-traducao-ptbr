It's been three years since
I quit the force and left
New York.

Now I'm a salesman for this
outfit called Red Crown.

On the surface, Red Crown's
a door-to-door sales firm

But Ed, the boss, has
himself a little business
on the side.
<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00101FF><n 0>
He finds things that don't
always want to be found.
Keeps it quiet, too.

From time to time, I lend
a hand.

It's a story I heard from

First, there was a young

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Both of 'em looked beat
down when they arrived.
Like they had no future...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
But by next mornin', they'd
been reborn. Their faces
were just...peaceful, like.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Well, I was surprised as a
dog'n a tree, so I asked
'em what happened.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>
And ya know what? They
both told me the same
thing.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>
"Room 215 is magic. It granted 
m'wish. Everything's OK now." 

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>

I heard she was just standing

That <color red>young man <color white>who checked

I guess he saw her on his

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
But then he found out she
doesn't talk, so he left her
here. You believe it?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Pretty cold if you ask me!
Leaving her here all alone
like that! Just ain't right.
