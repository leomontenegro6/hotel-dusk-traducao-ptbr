I hear whistling in the linen
room and catch Louie
slacking. He tells me a
hotel ghost story, that
lost and found stuff is
kept in Dunning's office,
and that his pal Danny
got iced three years ago.
After Louie heads back to
work, I toss the linen
room and find one of the
items I'm looking for:
the men's magazine.
While Dunning's out of the
office, I wander in and 
confirm that a Kyle Hyde
stayed in Room 217 six
months ago. I also get a
file cabinet open and find
the small red box that
was on my wish list.
I'm feeling good about 
finding the items on the
order sheet, but my mood
sours when Ed calls. He
tells me that when Louie's
pal Danny got killed, Nile
money went missing...and
now Nile wants Louie.
I press Louie about Danny's
murder and learn more
than I'd bargained for.
Seems Bradley was using
Danny to try and steal a
painting from Nile's
warehouse.
After he spills his guts,
Louie offers to help me
search for Bradley. Thing
is, I want answers, and 
Louie wants blood. Bad
things are in the air...
I can feel it.
