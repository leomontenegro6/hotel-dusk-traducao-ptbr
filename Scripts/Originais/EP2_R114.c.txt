We need to talk.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
Yeah? Well, you might wanna
talk, but I don't wanna listen.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I told ya, man, I wanna leave
everything in the past. So
just...leave me alone, dig?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Can't do it.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I gotta talk to you, Louie.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Aw, man! What now? You

old times again or what?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
When I mentioned Nile, you
looked like you were going
to be sick.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Why is that, Louie?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Speak up. I can't hear you.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>

Too bad, Louie.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Why not?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
<e 41>'Cause I don't, man. Simple
as that. No special reason.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
What, you're my shrink now?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000116><n 0>
Oh, you're gonna talk. You'll
talk, or we'll go 'round and
'round.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
I AIN'T TALKIN'! Kick me
around or whatever. Makes
no difference, man.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
I know the score, Louie.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000116><n 0>
You don't want to tell me
your dead pal was neck
deep in Nile's business.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000116><n 0>
That's it. Isn't it?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Whaµ? Dammit, man!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
<e 07>How'd you know that?!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Who told ya about <color red>Danny<color white>?


<sprite 0000104><color red>Who killed Danny?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I told ya to get out,

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Not gonna happen.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
We gotta chat, Louie.
You hear me?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Talk away, man. I ain't gotta
listen.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'm going to keep asking
until you start talking.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I got bad news, Louie.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Nile's looking for you.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
<color red>...WHAT?<color white>


<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>That got his attention...<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What is it?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
That shouldn't be a
surprise.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
<e 41>...N-no, man, no. Nothin'
like that.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
I ain't that surprised.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That's the straight skinny
from LAPD.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
Man! Why this crap gotta
happen now?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
This is why I <color red>split New York<color white>
in the first place!

<sprite 0000104><color red>Why'd you leave Manhattan?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
N-no, man, I... I don't
know.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
I don't know anything.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Clamming up won't help.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
When your boy Danny took
the big sleep, a lot of cash
went missing.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Nile thinks you have it.
Thinks you bolted town with
a briefcase full'a dough.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000407><n 0>
<color red>That's impossible.<color white>


<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>Wish it were, Louie...<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Keep calm, Louie.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What's impossible?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
<e 41>...Nothin', man.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Don't worry about it.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
So did you boost the dough
or what?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
Get off my case, man!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
I don't know anything 'bout
<color red>Danny's money<color white>!

<sprite 0000104><color red>Where's Danny's money?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000415><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000412><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'm gonna ask once more.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Nile thinks you're a patsy.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And until they know who the 
big man is, they'll keep
watching you.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You hear what I'm saying?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
...They're not gonna kill me?
At least, not right now?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
That's it, right?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
That's it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
...This is a trip and a half,
man.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I think I know who killed 
Danny.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
It was you, wasn't it?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
<e 41>...What're you talkin' about?!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
You think I did it? You  
suspect me? Accuse me
like that?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
No way, man! No way I'd do
somethin' like that!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
It wasn't you, was it?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
'Course not! 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
There's no way I'd kill him!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
So who was it?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
C'mon, man...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Talk, Louie. If you didn't kill 
Danny, who did?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000412><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000412><n 0>
...It was J.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
J?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah, that's what Danny
called him, all right? <color red>J<color white>.

<sprite 0000104><color red>Who's J?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Why'd you leave the city?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Let me guess.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
It's 'cause you stole all that
money, right?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
<e 41>Oh, you got me, man. I stole
the money. That's why I work
in this dump.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
You're way wrong.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Was it because Danny got
killed?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000407><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Had to get outta the city
'cause your buddy got
cut down?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
That why you left? Why you
fled a crime scene?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Don't tell me that had
nothing to do with your
little cross-country trip.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
...Had everything to do with
it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
We had a plan, ya know?
A good plan.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
If Danny's job went OK, we
were gonna blow outta
there.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Drop everything and run?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah... Least, that was the
plan.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Why?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
I'll tell ya, but you won't
get it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Danny and me were a 
couple'a poor suckers
from the street.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
No family, no nothing. Just
two punks with no future.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
Problem is, neither of us
had the nerve to make it
as big-time crooks.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
So...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
We were gonna go someplace
else, ya know? Become new
people with new lives.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah... What a couple of
losers, right?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
What happened?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
We needed some serious
bread to get outta the
city.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Danny was gonna get the
money by doing one last
<color red>big job<color white>.
<sprite 0000104><color red>A final big job?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I tried to stop him, man.
Told him it was too risky.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But he wouldn't listen...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
He always was an idiot. 


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I bet I know who stole the
money Danny was carrying.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And it wasn't you. So who
took it?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Man, it was...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
It was the guy who killed him!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Was it you?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
<e 41>C'mon, man. Don't be stupid.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
If I had that kinda bread,
you think I'd be workin'
here?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I'm a dope, but not stupid.
That's the kinda thing gets
a man killed.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Who's J?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Some cat what works for
Nile.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
He and Danny used to run
together.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Ever meet him?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
No.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Just heard about him from
Danny.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Said J was some kinda
insurance-fraud pro.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
He'd get an art collector to
insure something for a ton
of cash, yeah?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Then Nile would steal the
piece, and the insurance
money would roll in.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
When it was over, Nile sold
the art back to the mark
for big money.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Danny was baggin' the money 
from one of those sales.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Was Danny working with J
when he got whacked?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
That's what he told me.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
'Course, he told me a lot
of things...

<sprite 0000125><color red>Why was Danny killed?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Why was Danny killed?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
...He got suckered.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Suckered?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Danny was gonna lift this
<color red>angel painting<color white> from Nile's
hideout, ya know?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But all he did was get
himself killed.

<sprite 0000125><color red>An angel painting?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
Well, that ain't exactly
right...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
It wasn't his idea to boost
the painting.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
It was J's.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What was this angel painting? 


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
No clue, man. That's just 
what Danny called it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Some big painting he found
in Nile's warehouse.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
He was crazy 'bout the
stupid thing.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Said it was worth a fortune.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Said if we could score it,
we'd be set for life. Cars,
clothes, babes, everything.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Ever see this painting?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
Naw, just heard Danny run his 
mouth about it.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So what was the big job?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
At first, it was just lifting  
this painting, yeah?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But things started gettin'
outta control fast.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
He started talkin' about
takin' all kinds of art stuff
they had stashed.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
He wanted to steal Nile's
entire collection? Not
smart.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
You tellin' me, man? 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
But look, Danny didn't come 
up with this on his own.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
He was just sucked into
J's plan.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
J's plan...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000404><n 0>
What ya writin'?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000404><n 0>
What ya lookin' at?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
...What?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
You don't get it, do ya? You
don't understand a damned
thing!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Not about Danny, and not
about Nile. You're a total
washout, man.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
You sayin' you do?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah, man. More'n you at

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
<m 160>So enlighten me, Einstein.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Tell me how smart you are.


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
<m 021>Night Danny died?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I was trippin' out 'cause he
never showed at the
restaurant, right?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
So I head over to check
out Nile's warehouse.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Soon as I walk up to the
door... BANG!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Somebody inside fires a gun.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I duck down, scoot over
to the door, and take a
peek inside...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Know what I see, man?

It's Danny. Guy shot him

That was three years ago.
December 24th, 1976.
I'll never forget it.

The guy who shot Danny...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
It was J.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Danny was just lying there,
bleedin' and cryin' and...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
But I had nothin', man. No

Too late, man.

Guy could barely talk, but
he managed to tell me one
thing...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Said he'd been tricked.
...Said J was a cop.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
Then he actually apologized
to me. Said he was sorry he
couldn't get us the money.

<e 07>That's who killed Danny!

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000124><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>

And nobody cared, right? 
Just some dead street

Your partner gettin' shot

He screwed up his case and

what he deserved.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
That's the reason ya got

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
