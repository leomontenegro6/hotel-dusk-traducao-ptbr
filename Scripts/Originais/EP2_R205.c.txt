This hanger's attached to
the rack.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
It's a wire hanger.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
<color blue>I bet this thick wire will come <color white>

What are you saying? I always

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
I think we have a different  
idea of what that phrase
means.
<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Maybe, but mine's right.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Tell me something, will you? 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
There a kid named Louis
DeNonno working there at
the Hotel Dusk?
<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
DeNonno? Yeah, he's the
bellhop. I knew him from
back in the day.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Said he left the city and
drifted out here 'bout
three years ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
You know the kid, huh?
What's his story?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Just a punk who used to
ride the subways picking
pockets.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Can't tell you how many
times I busted his ass.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Why? What's going on?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
I just got back from meeting
a buddy of mine. He's LAPD.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Guy heads up their Nile task
force, and he saidµ

<b 0168>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Wait, hold it. 


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
You've got friends on the
Nile case?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Yeah, I know some guys
working on it. Don't get your
panties in a bunch.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Anyway, we're having a drink, 
shooting the breeze, and he
mentions Hotel Dusk.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Then he tells me about some
scuzz named Louis DeNonno
who's working there.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Seems Nile's been looking for 
this mope.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
That doesn't make sense.
Louie's small-time.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Nile wouldn't care if he lives 
or dies.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Well, three years ago a stiff
turned up near a warehouse
in Manhattan.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Some kid named Danny was
up to his eyeballs with Nile,
and he got himself offed.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
NYPD wrote it off as gangs
or Mafia or the like.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Hell, you know the drill: no
witnesses, no leads, nobody
ever brought in.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
What's this got to do with
Louie?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
I'm getting there, Hyde!
Relax, will ya?! You sound
like my ex sometimes...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Anyway, seems your boy
DeNonno's right in the
middle'a all this.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
The night Danny got aired
out, he was the bagman for
a buncha payoff scratch.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
'Course, when Danny boy
buys it, the bribe money
vanishes.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Word on the street is Danny
was buddy-buddy with your
pal, Louie.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
And here's where it gets
good; after Danny cashes 
out, Louie vanishes. POOF!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
So now Nile wants their money 
back, and this kid's the only
lead.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
They been looking all over
hell and breakfast, and now
we think they found him.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
They must really be on the 
hunt if they tracked him
to this dive.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
So if they know where Louie
is, why's he still breathing?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
They think he's a patsy.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Think there's somebody else
calling the shots, pulling
the strings, ya know?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Nile...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Never thought I'd hear that 
name in this place.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Total coincidence.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I don't know...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
You think so?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Don't think so. Know so.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Oh, and I got another tidbit
for ya.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
The Nile money that Danny
was carrying when he got
smoked?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
They got the cash by
fencing stolen art.

<b 0142>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
...Hang on.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
The cash was from that mess 
Bradley was involved in?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Could be.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
That would mean Louie...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Yeah, he may have some
dirt on Bradley we never
heard.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
...Huh.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Tell me something, Hyde.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
You find the stuff on the
order sheet?

<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Taken care of. Don't worry
about it.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Good.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
Business before vengeance,
ya know? Har har har!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001502><n 0>
