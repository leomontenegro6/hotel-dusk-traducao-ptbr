On the way to dinner,
I catch Melissa's old
man, Kevin, giving her an
earful. Guy's some kind of
sawbones, and he seems
real worried that Melissa 
said something about his
missing wife.
Louie's playing host at the
restaurant entrance. He
tells me that Room 217,
where the other me was, 
has been empty for six 
months. I ask him to lift 
the room key for me,
then go to dinner.
Before I can get inside, I 
run into Iris from 216. She
says that Melissa smacked
her with a rag doll. When
I get inside, I find the doll
on a chair and take it.
When I finish stuffing my
face with Rosa's home
cooking, Summer shows.
He asks if there was a
bookmark in the package
Louie brought. Then Rosa
tells me that he's actually
a best-selling novelist.
After dinner, Louie shows
me a fountain pen he
found. The words "To Alan,
with love" are engraved
on it, but there's no one
named Alan in this place.
I take the doll up to 219
and give it to Melissa, who
makes me be her puzzle
patsy again. Seems the 
puzzle's a gift from her
missing mom, and she left
a good-bye message on
the back of it.
I search the box in my
room and find Summer's
missing bookmark with an
angel picture on it. I take
it to Summer and learn
it shows the Angel Opening
a Door, which was painted
by a cat called Osterzone.
More problems with Melissa.
She and the old man get
into it, and she runs to
Room 218. Problem is, the
room's got no power, and
she gets locked in. I fix
the switchboard and get
her out in one piece.
Melissa says her folks
fought like cats in the
rain, and that's why her
mom split. Kid seems
pretty torn up about the
whole thing, and I guess I
can't blame her.
