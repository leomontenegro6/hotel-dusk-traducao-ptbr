<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Well, his first book came out
about ten years ago and won
some major awards.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
Publishers were very excited. 
They called him "the
maestro of mysteries."
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>

<m 021>So what's The Secret Word 
about?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000302><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000301><n 0>
It's about a man who commits 
the perfect crime!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
He does so to get revenge
on a friend who betrayed
him!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
Critics called it a gritty  
descent into the darkness 
of the human soul.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00003FF><n 0>
It's really quite shocking.
Oh, listen to me! Rosa the
book reviewer!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Revenge on a friend, huh?
Hell of an idea.
