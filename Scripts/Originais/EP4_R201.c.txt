Can I get that autograph?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Most certainly.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
Now where should I <color red>pen <color white>my
John Hancock?

<sprite 0000125><color red>He seems pleased...<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You get asked for autographs 
a lot?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Oh, yes. I'm afraid it's become
a part of my daily life.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
There are so many fans who
wish for me to sign this or
that, you see?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
And the requests to have
photographs taken together
are numerous as well.
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
To be frank, there are times
when it all wears quite thin.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
But then again, when you're
a famous writer such as
myself...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Well, it seems I can't go
anywhere without drawing
a crowd.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
That is why I was so excited
for this chance to relax and
unwind.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
I had hoped to find solace
in this<color red> unknown hotel<color white>, but
<color red>some things never change<color white>...

<color blue>Cripes, this guy likes to<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Keep talking.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000807><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Doesn't get much more
unknown than this, huh?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Agreed! Yes, at times when I
find myself drained by the
rigors of the craft,
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
I will ofttimes set out in my
automobile and let the open
road take me where it will!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
On these journeys, I make a 
habit of staying at cheap and 
unknown hotels.
<sprite 0000125><color red>But you got a package...<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Stuff doesn't change, huh?
What's that mean?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
No matter where I choose to
stay, I'm soon exposed as
a famous novelist, you see?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
This is followed by the usual
requests for pictures and
autographs...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Was that your fountain pen?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000802><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Yes, it was.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Really?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
I said yes, and I meant it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Is there some sort of
problem, Mr. Hyde?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
What's your name?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
My name? My dear man,
have you forgotten
already? It's Martin Summer.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Exactly. Your name's
Martin Summer.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
But that's not the name
inscribed on the pen.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
The name on the pen is
Alan.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000807><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So you want to tell me
again that this is really
your pen?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
Wh-what are you implying,
sir? It is most certainly
my pen.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
Alan is...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
Alan is my real name.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Oh yeah?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Yes. Martin Summer is my

name, if you will.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
However, my real name is
Alan... Alan Parker!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
That's comforting.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
So where do you think I
found your pen?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
I believe I dropped it in the
lobby.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Nice try, Shakespeare.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
It was in the restaurant.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
Is that so?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
I dropped it in the restaurant,
did I?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
I had no idea whatsoever.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You sure it's your pen?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Yes, I'm certain.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
But the name inscribed on
the pen isn't yours.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
The name on the pen is
Alan.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000807><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
Oh, well, you see, Alan is...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
Alan is my real name.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Do tell.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Yes. Martin Summer is
my nom de plume. My pen

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
However, my real name is
Alan... Alan Parker!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
That's comforting.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So you just decided to stay
here on a whim?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
That's correct.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Really?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Yes. Really.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
<color blue>Why's this overblown windbag <color white>
<color blue>lying to me?<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>There's no way he could<color white>
<color blue>have a package delivered<color white>
<color blue>here if that were true.<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Sign this, will you?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000802><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Certainly.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000816><n 0>
Let me just take up the
pen and... Hmm?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
Well, I was certain my pen
was just here... How odd.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
What's the problem?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
Unfortunately, I seem to
have misplaced my pen.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
Bother. I can't very well sign
anything without a pen,
now can I?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Sign this, will you?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000802><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Of course.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
<e 11><s 2001010>Summer signs the book.
<s 2001010>Takes his time about it,

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
<e 15>Is this acceptable?


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000103><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
I must say, securing my
autograph is not usually
such a simple task.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
Normally there are lines to
be waited in and such, but
let us consider this a favor.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000101><n 0>
Sign this, will you?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000802><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
I beg your pardon, but I
already did. It wouldn't do
to sign something twice.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
This yours?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000802><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000807><n 0>
Why, yes, it is.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
I picked it up earlier.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
Is that so?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
You have my gratitude, sir!


<sprite 0000125><color red>So this pen is Summer's?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
May I ask what you are
writing?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
May I ask what you are

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Mr. Hyde?

If you will excuse me for a

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Where you going?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
I fear I need to use the

Oh, yeah, sure. Knock

Do you perchance have a

Mr. Hyde! Please! Have you

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
All right.

Hmm? It's that notebook

Let's see what all the fuss

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, may I ask what

This won't take too long.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
What is it?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Look, I'm just an average Joe.
A salesman who doesn't spend 
time reading, you know?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
But talking with you, a guy
who's written a best seller,
got me to thinking...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
What's it like to write a book? 
To have strangers know
you and all that jazz?
<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000803><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
So I was hoping you could
fill me in on a couple of
things.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Like, how do you write a
best seller? Stuff like that.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
How does one write a best-
selling novel? Is that what
you are asking me?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah! I mean, you wrote
The Secret Word, and
everybody read it, right?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
So teach me. Tell me how
to come up with a story
that everyone loves.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
Oh ho ho! My dear man, the
essence of a novel is not
something so easily distilled.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
C'mon, Summer. I ain't asking
how to turn lead into gold.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I just want a few pointers
so I can take a stab at this
writing gig myself.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Mr. Hyde...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
What you are thinking is
<color red>very nearly impossible<color white>.

<sprite 0000124><color red>！<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>I thought you'd say that,<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
What do you mean by
impossible?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
<e 41>Bu... But you can't...
Be reasonable, sir!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
I intend no offense, but the
thought of a man such as
you taking up the pen is...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
The world of literature is not
such an easy and forgiving
place. Speak no more of it!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I guess I got the idea after
seeing that notebook.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
...Notebook?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah, the old notebook that
got delivered to me by
mistake.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That was the manuscript for
your novel, right?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I mean, it looked like the
same story to me, but what
do I know?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
So anyway, that's how you
get started writing a book,
right?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000808><n 0>
Yes, butｵ


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000812><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, you read my

<sprite 0000125><color red>Why's he so worked up?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Yeah. I did.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
And you know what else?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
There's something odd about
it.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
The handwriting in the

...Um...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>Got you on the ropes now,<color white>
<color blue>don't I, Shakespeare?<color white>

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Give it up.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00008FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I don't think it's really

<e 41>What are you talking about?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
Of course it's mine!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The handwriting inside didn't
look anything like your

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Maybe you...I don't know...
dictated your story to
someone?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000812><n 0>
This...this conversation is
beyond the pale, sir!
<color red>Beyond the pale<color white> indeed!
<sprite 0000125><color red>Why's he so mad over this? <color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
And you know what else?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Sorry about this, but let me
ask you one more time.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00008FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
My good man! Enough!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
How much longer must I

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
See, I can't get that pen out

Does that pen really

<e 41>Are you implying something,
sir?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
It is indeed my pen.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You told me that your real

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You're a liar. Your name's

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000808><n 0>
What did you say?!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Martin Summer's not your

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
Now see here! I... I won't...


<sprite 0000125><color red>So who the hell's Alan?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
OK. Let's go over this again.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
The question is, which

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The fact that your debut

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000807><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>

Mr. Hyde, I must ask you

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Like I said, pal. Just a

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000812><n 0>
Then why are you going to
expose my secrets?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
That's not my plan. There's
nothing in it for me.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And blackmail's a dangerous
game that I won't play.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I just want the truth.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000807><n 0>
<m 100>The truth?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
The truth is something I fear, 
lest it be discovered and

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
It haunts me, and has kept

Mr. Hyde... If I could take

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
If for one moment I could
share them with another
human being...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
It might not be too late.
I might yet be able to make
a fresh start.

<m 014>Please, Mr. Hyde, would you
do me the favor of hearing
my sad, ponderous tale?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
When I was young, I wanted
nothing more than to be
a novelist.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Upon graduating university,
I found work writing for a
small magazine.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
I reported local news by day
and chased my dream every
other waking moment.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
And yet, as the years slipped
by, I realized I was failing...
and fading.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
I was incapable. I had no
muse to guide me, no words
would come, I... I...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
I prepared to let my dream
wither and die.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
But it was at that moment,
my darkest hour, that I met
Alan.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Guy who owns the pen.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
That's correct. Alan, he...
He was my friend.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Keep going.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
We frequented the same cafe
and knew each other's faces
well.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
One day we struck up a
conversation, and soon
after became fast friends.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Our lives were very strikingly 
similar. We were the same
age, for one.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
In addition, we were both
reporters, and we had both
been raised by our fathers.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
The thing that surprised me
most was discovering Alan's
dream for the future.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
As you may have surmised,
Alan, too, longed to be a
novelist. And yet...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Although we shared many
similarities, there was one
aspect where we differed.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Alan had not abandoned his
dream. In fact, he was
totally consumed by it.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
He pursued the craft with a
fervor and desire I could
only faintly recall.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Moreover, he was a man of
immense talent.

As for myself, I never shared

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
For some reason, I simply
did not wish to speak to
him of that.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
So Alan knew nothing of my

day he...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
He gave to me a manuscript
that was to be his entry
in a writing contest.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Humbled by his trust, I gave

It was...amazing. A work of

Alan had actually done it.

He would be a novelist.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
I couldn't think. I was drained,
empty, filled with jealousy

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
And into this dark void an

born.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>

It was like being part of a

And yet, I am no closer to
finding him than I was when
I started.

<m 007>Mr. Hyde, I became a novelist 
by stealing Alan's work, but...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
I do not possess his talent.
Each book I write is poorer
than the one before...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
And then...the unthinkable. 
My assistant, Dan, found 
Alan's purloined notebook.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
So you paid Dan off and he
sent you the notebook.
That it?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
...Yes, it is.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
So why'd you choose this
hotel to take care of your
transaction?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
That, at least, is a question
which I can answer quite
easily.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
I had heard of this hotel
from Alan.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
He told me that Hotel Dusk
was a special place to him.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
He said something very
important happened to
him here.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Something important, huh?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000803><n 0>
Yes.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Alan mentioned it to me but
once.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
Whatever it was, I could see
how he treasured and
safeguarded it.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Yeah, I'd treasure this rathole,
too.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, I...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Can it. I'm done with you.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'll see you around.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Yeah?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
I had hoped my conversation
with you would prove more
entertaining.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Want me to juggle?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
You, sir, are nothing more
than a discourteous lout.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
There is nothing more I wish
to discuss with you.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
This has been a most
unpleasant experience.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
<e 07>Please leave.

Way to go, Hyde. You
couldn't think your way
out of a paper bag.

Always screwing things up
like this...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Hell, who are you kidding?
You'll never find Bradley...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000112><n 0>
You're a total loser, Hyde.
Always have been.
Always will be.

Hyde spent the rest of the
night brooding in his room.
