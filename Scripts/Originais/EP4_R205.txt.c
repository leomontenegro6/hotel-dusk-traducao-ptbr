<e 23>It's more fun talking to you,

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Let's hear it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
He says he's going to be

<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Went out again, huh?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Mmm-hmm.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
He went to see his friend in

<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
But I'm supposed to ask if
you need anything.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
So do you?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Not right now. But...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
But what?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
C'mon, Kyle. If there's
something I can do, just
ask.
<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
All right. I need you to check
something for me.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
You got it, handsome. What
am I looking for?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I need information on a man
named Osterzone.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
That's a name?


<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah, Osterzone. Guy's a

Angel Opening a Door.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Well, aren't you cultured?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
All right, sweetie. I'll call

<b 0134>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>

It's me. You need something?


<b 0135>

Left you alone again, did he?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
I know! It's pretty unbelievable 
to me, too.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Silly man prefers the company

<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Anyway, he wanted me to ask
if you needed anything.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
So do you?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I need him to give you a raise.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Oh, aren't you the sweetest

do you need anything?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
All you have to do is ask.


<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
As long as you're offering,
there is this one thing...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Let me have it, handsome.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I need information on a guy
named Osterzone.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Oster... Osterzone? Are you 
making this up, Kyle?

<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
If only. No, he's real. Painted
a picture called Angel
Opening a Door.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
He's a painter?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Why on earth do you need
information on a painter?

<b 0111>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Look, it's a long story, andµ


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
I know. You hate long stories. 
They're a pain in your behind. 
Osterzone, right?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah. Thanks, Rach.


<b 0135>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
