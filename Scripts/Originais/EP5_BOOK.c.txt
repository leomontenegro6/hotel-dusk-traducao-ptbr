I talk to Rachel, and she
gives me the goods on
Osterzone. She also tells
me that Angel Opening a
Door was swiped from a
Manhattan art museum
three years ago.
I drop by Rosa's room and
use my notebook to have
a chat with Mila. She tells
me that her old man's
name is Robert Evans,
and that the bracelet
she's wearing was a gift
from him.
Melissa comes calling and
asks me to fix her doll. 
While I play Betsy Ross, 
she tells me that Jeff
was in my room. He was
also in the linen room, 
and when I check it out,
I find a hidden pistol.
To get the skinny on Jeff,
I team up with Louie and
have him lure the punk 
out of his room. While he's
distracted, I go into his
room and take a buzz
through his things.
I find Jeff's student ID 
card, which is how I
learn his last name's
actually Damon. I confront
the kid, but he's harder
than I thought, and won't
crack about hiding the
cash in my john.
I remember a story in the
newspaper about a Beverly
Hills lawyer whose home 
was ransacked. It said the
thieves made off with cash
and a piece. With that info
in place, I decide to
question Jeff again.
Jeff comes clean and
admits hiding the loot in
my room. He also tells me
that his old man's a
crooked lawyer working for
Nile. He took the stuff so
he could get arrested and
spill his family secrets.
