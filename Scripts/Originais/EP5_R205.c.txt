You doing OK?


<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
What is it, Rachel?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Your usual cheery self, I see.
Listen, I dug up some info on
this Osterzone fellow.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Let me have it.


<b 0152>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
<e 23>You're welcome. OK, let's see...
He was born in England in 1875.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
And he died in 1910 at the 
age of thirty-five. Whole
career is one big mystery.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
The guy was a complete
unknown while he was alive.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Then, about forty years after
he died, ten or so of his
works were discovered.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Suddenly, people love his
stuff and he becomes the
art world's new darling.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
From what I've read, artsy
types appreciate his "subtle
and distinctive brushwork."
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
There are a lot of collectors
out there who want his
paintings in a big way.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
You wouldn't BELIEVE how much
folks are paying for his stuff!
It's crazy!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Oh, and his most valuable
painting is something called
Angel Opening a Door.
<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Angel Opening a Door, huh?


<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Mmm-hmm. But the thing's 
been stolen, so there you go.

<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Someone stole it?


<b 0134>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
That's right. It says here it
was taken from the Travis
Art Museum... Let's see...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Yep, three years ago.


<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Interesting.


<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Apparently it's the largest of
all Osterzone's paintings.
And the most popular.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Isn't this all just fascinating?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah.


<b 0135>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
So...Kyle? Sweetie?


<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Huh? 


<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Why the sudden interest in
dead painters?

<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Actually, I just wanted to know
about angel paintings.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Angel paintings? You mean
paintings of angels, right?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Yeah, whatever. Listen, I found
some dirt on Bradley in the
last few hours.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Bradley? That's the man you're
looking for, right? The one
you won't tell me about?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Bradley was my partner when
I was on the force.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Three years ago, he went
rogue and stabbed me in
the back.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Used his badge to steal a
boatload of cash and a big
angel painting.
<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Then he vanished...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I want to know what happened.
Why he did it. That's why I'm
tracking him down.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Oh...


<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Let me guess. Ed's out again, 
isn't he?

<b 0135>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Um...yeah. Yeah, he's out.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
I'll have him give you a ring
when he gets in.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Do it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
And, Kyle? Thanks for telling
me. About Bradley.

Hey, Rachel.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
I heard back on your mystery

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
You ready?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Go.


<b 0152>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
<e 23>You're welcome. OK, let's see...
He was born in England in 1875.

I guess the guy was a total

Suddenly, everybody goes

Artsy types like his "subtle

other stuff I don't get.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
But it must be a big deal,  
because collectors really
want his paintings.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
I'd need to sell my car and
everything in my apartment
just to look at the stuff.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Oh, and his most valuable
painting is something called
Angel Opening a Door.
<b 0132>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I know about that.


<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
But did you know someone
stole it, Mr. I'm-A-Great-
Detective?
<b 0110>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
...I did not know that.


<b 0134>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
See? I should be your 
partner!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Anyway, yeah, someone took
it from the Travis Art Gallery 
three years ago.
<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Interesting.


<b 0111>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
It's his most popular painting,
and it's also really big. Must
have been hard to steal.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Isn't art fascinating?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Oh yeah. I'm heading for a

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Bradley vanished three years

And my friend.
<b 0152>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Oh... Oh, Kyle, I didn'tµ


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Don't interrupt, or I'll never 
finish. Three years ago I
was a cop in New York.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Bradley and I were in charge
of a task force investigating
a crime syndicate called Nile.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Something went wrong and
Bradley threw it all away. He
betrayed us.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
He hit Nile for a king's ransom
and an angel painting, then did
his best Houdini act.
<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I want to know why.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>

No wonder you're so cheery

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
Is that why you gave up
your badge?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00016FF><n 0>
To try and find this guy?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Could be.
