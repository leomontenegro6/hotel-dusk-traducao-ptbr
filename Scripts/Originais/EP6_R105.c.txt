<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
I prefer my barkeeps to be
prettier... But I guess you'll
do.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Now why you wanna go and
hurt me like that?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Ain't no one else could look
this good behind the counter! 

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Hope you tend bar better
than you deliver packages.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Lemme tell you a secret, my
man... This here is the best
place in the whole hotel.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Most every job old man
Dunning makes me do
is a total drag.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Makes me wanna take a long 
lunch and just keep on
walkin', ya dig?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
'Cept this one. Brother, I
could stand back here all

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000404><n 0>
So whaddya think? Beauty
of a bar, ain't she?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000109><n 0>
Not bad.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
Damn straight!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
So c'mon, Hyde! Take a load
off, for once.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000405><n 0>
What's your poison?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Bourbon. Make it a double.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000404><n 0>
Hyde, my man? You got no
idea what Louie has in store
for ya...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
This, my brother? This is an
eight-year bourbon from the
grasslands of Kentucky.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000405><n 0>
And it's on me. 


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000109><n 0>

Louie sets my drink on the
counter and leaves me in
peace. ...Good man.
<b 0176>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
I swirl the deep amber around
the glass and listen to the
music of the ice.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
It smells of good earth, with
hints of charcoal dancing
around the edges.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 65534FF><n 0>



<b 0177>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 65534FF><n 0>
The first sip is a slow burn.
I sit for a moment, letting the
fire spread through me...

...HA HA HA! Oh, my brother,
my BROTHER!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Been forever since I seen a
cat make a drink look that
good!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Been a long time since I had
an eight-year. Thanks, Louie.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
Hey, you're the cat what 
made my day! Feel like the
best barman in L.A. now! 
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000404><n 0>
Say, Hyde, I don't mean to
interrupt your quiet time
or nothin'.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
But we got us a jukebox in
the corner there if you 
want some drinking tunes.
<sprite 0000125><color red>This dump has a jukebox?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Oh, and see those matches
on the shelf over there?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
My work, man. <color red>Matches<color white> <color red>by<color white>
<color red>Louis DeNonno.<color white>

<sprite 0000125><color red>You make matches?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Check 'em out when you got 
a sec. It's a trip.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Oh, and there's somethin'
else I gotta clue ya in on.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Spill it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
It's about the cat what was
here six months ago. The
one with your name?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah, so the day he stayed
here?<color red> Me and Rosa were<color white>
<color red>both out.<color white>
<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>...That's interesting.<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
And no one's been in 217
since that day, right?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
That's right.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
So what's the story?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You have enough of Dunning's
crap and call in sick?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Naw, man. Wasn't like that.
I had me a planned vacation.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Dunning gave you a day off?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
For real, man. Rosa, too.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Days where me and Rosa
both catch a break are 
pretty rare.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I don't think Mama Sass was
even s'posed to get that
day off.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But I guess Dunning got his
wires crossed, 'cause she
was outta here, too.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
So, yeah. Me and Rosa both
missed out on <color red>seeing that<color white>
<color red>cat's face<color white>. Total drag.
<sprite 0000125><color red>So only Dunning saw him?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000409><n 0>
If that guy was really your
amigo Bradley, then he's
got some kinda luck.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
If I'd been there...?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000414><n 0>
Woulda killed him on the spot 
with how he done for Danny!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You have a jukebox? And it
works?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
I know. Trip, right?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Ain't the newest model or
nothin', but it gives the old
bar some class.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
What's a song run me?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Can't charge for MUSIC, man! 
Thing's free as can be.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000404><n 0>
You see a song you like, just
give it a spin.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So tell me about these
matches of yours.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Dig it, man. Label's a custom
DeNonno original!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
'Fore I came, place didn't  
even HAVE matches.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So Dunning's the only one
who saw the mystery man?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
You got it. Hey... Why don't
I show the boss a photo
of Bradley!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I'm sure the old coot could
tell if he was the mystery
guest or not, yeah?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Works for me.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
Dig it, man. I'll just show him
the photo like it's no big,
and see what he says.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000405><n 0>
Leave it to me, my man! 
Plan'll go down smooth
as that bourbon!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Thanks, Louie.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
You know, I don't get this,
Hyde.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Say the guy what stayed here 
really was Bradley.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
I mean, why's he come here?
What's he thinkin'?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Guy musta had SOME reason
for comin' here, yeah?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I don't know, Louie. I can't
figure that out.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You and Rosa both had the
same day off?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I know, man. Trip, right?

Yeah, about that. Sorry...
It was a pretty low move.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
Oh, heavens. Don't give it a

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
I managed just fine on my

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
But perhaps you should be
more considerate of your

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>

this evening?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'm a man of habit. First one's
always a bourbon.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Then I let the others take

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
You don't say?

What's your drink of choice?

Oh goodness! You don't have
to do anything like that!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>

And you, Mr. Hyde? 


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Same story. No family, no ties.
I'll tell you something, though.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
This is the first time I ever
spent the last Friday of the
year in a hotel bar.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
And the first one I ever spent
with a nice, gimlet-drinking
lady like yourself.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000705><n 0>
Oh, Mr. Hyde! You certainly
are a charmer!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Now that I think about it, you
said something when I first
saw you.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You wanted to stay in the
room that grants wishes,
right?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
That is correct.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000710><n 0>
There's a wish of mine that 
simply <color red>must come true<color white>, no
matter what.
<sprite 0000125><color red>A wish that must come true?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000710><n 0>
That's why I came to this
hotel, you see.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
C'mon, that's just Dunning
flapping his gums. You really
believe that fairy tale?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
And is it such a shame if I
do believe it, Mr. Hyde?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
Perhaps the fairy-tale nature
of the story makes me more
inclined to believe, hmm?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You always been alone?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000702><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Oh no. No, not always.<color red> There<color white>
<color red>was a time when I had <color white>
<color red>someone in my life.<color white>
<sprite 0000125><color red>So you had family once?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
A lot can happen when you
live as long as I have.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So what's this wish of yours?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000702><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Now now, Mr. Hyde. That's
my secret.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
All people have at least one
genuine wish in their heart,
don't you think?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
But you never really hear
about such things, because
they are so personal.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
Not the kind of thing you'd
just give away to anyone,
don't you agree?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So you had family once?

Not everything you hoped it
would be?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000705><n 0>
Oh no, it's nothing like that. 
It's just...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
Well, it's all in the past, you
see. Nothing interesting to
speak of.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
You don't want to talk about
it, I'll mind my business...and
my drink.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Just thought hearing about 
you in the heyday might be
a kick in the pants.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000704><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, what are you 
writing there?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000704><n 0>
What are you looking at,

Now, Mr. Hyde, how would you 
like to play a little game with
me?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Just to pass the time until
your bourbon comes.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
I'm not much for games.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
Oh, but you'll like this one!
It's more of a trick, really.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000714><n 0>
Now just give me one moment 
to set this up...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00007FF><n 0>
...All right, I think that should
do.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Now, as you can see, I have 
six coins in front of me.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
You must arrange them so
there are four in a row both
vertically and horizontally.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Oh, but here's the fun part...
You can only move one coin!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
Do you think you can beat
my little game, Mr. Hyde?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
OK, I'll bite.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
But if I win, you have to tell
me about your past. Deal?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
Agreed!

You must arrange them so

You're not giving up already,

Perhaps it was too easy for

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000710><n 0>
Very well then! As promised,
I'll tell you a little bit about

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>

You are a curious fellow, sir,

Well, during our chat, I failed

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
Three years ago, you see,

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
Not two hours ago, you did
not even know the name
of Osterzone!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
How did you manage to find

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I did a little research.

how did you manage this?
