Don't worry about it.

Oh, yes, dear.

Don't you get excited when

You make me feel like I did

<sprite 0000125><color red>What happened ten years ago?<color white>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000705><n 0>
And what would that be?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Rosa said you shared that wine

<e 41>I can't say that I appreciate

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
I have no intentions of

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
It isn't the end of the world,

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
Oh?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You told me you've been here

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
So when did you share a

someone?
<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00007FF><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, you are persistent! 
If you must know, <color red>that day<color white>

<sprite 0000125><color red>Who'd she meet ten years ago?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>

<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Let me guess.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00007FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So he's pushing up daisies
or what?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
<e 41>Heaven forbid!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
No! No, of course not! I can't
believe that's true!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You don't know where he
is, do you?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000703><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
I'm sure he's fine. It's just...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
We just <color red>haven't been in<color white>
<color red>contact <color white>since that day.

<sprite 0000125><color red>Why weren't they in contact?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Let's talk about the person
you met ten years ago.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000702><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
It was someone you hate.

<e 41>Heaven forbid!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
Whatever are you saying,
Mr. Hyde? No, of course
not!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The person is pretty special
to you. Right?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
Oh, yes.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
That person meant the world

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
But then I... I...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
I <color red>betrayed<color white> him.


<sprite 0000125><color red>Why would she betray someone?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I wouldn't think it would be

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000702><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
But I bet I know why you
haven't.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00007FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
I think he forgot you.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
<e 41>Nonsense! He would never
forget me!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
No! No... Impossible!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
You think about him a lot,
don't you?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
Oh, yes. Each and every day.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000710><n 0>
I want so badly to see him 
again... But alas, I cannot.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000710><n 0>
I can't bear the thought of
causing<color red> the boy <color white>more grief.

<sprite 0000125><color red>What boy is this?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I think I know who you're

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
I... But how...

It's your son. Isn't it?

That was the man I met ten

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What's his name?

<color red>Alan.<color white>


<sprite 0000125><color red>Alan, huh?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Why did you betray him?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000702><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
Because I'm selfish! Because
I was thinking only of myself.
Of what I thought I wanted.   
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
I left him behind, Mr. Hyde.
I abandoned him.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Your son's name is Alan?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000702><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
Yes, that's correct.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Alan Parker.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
<s 4003010>Nice name.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
<m 006>We met here for dinner ten

our separate ways.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Any chance you gave him a

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
...Why, yes. Yes I did!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
But how on earth could you

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So this is your son's pen,
huh?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
That's correct.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
I gave it to him ten years

<sprite 0000125><color red>Finally reunited, huh?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You were on the outs for a

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000702><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
It was because I... I...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
I left him behind.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
I abandoned him, Mr. Hyde.

How did that pen come to be

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I found it in the restaurant.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
A guest dropped it.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000707><n 0>
A guest dropped...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00007FF><n 0>
So my son...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
That means Alan is in this
hotel!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
No. He's not.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
But then... Who dropped the
pen, if not him?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
A friend of his. Well, he's not
much of a friend, actually.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
But... But why? How? Oh,
this is all too much!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Alan is missing. Guy with the
pen is looking for him.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000707><n 0>
My boy is missing? Please,
Mr. Hyde, tell me that is
not true!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
As I understand it, Alan wrote
a book and this chump stole
it from him.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Sounds like your boy was
shook up about it, and 
vanished soon after.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00007FF><n 0>
That...that can't be...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Wish I had better news for
you, but there it is.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
My son had always dreamed
of being a writer.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
On that night ten years ago,
he told me that he'd almost
achieved his dream.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
It was hard work, but I knew
he would never give up.
It was a dream, after all.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000709><n 0>
Oh, to think that it has been 
taken from him! It breaks
my heart... It truly does.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Yeah, that's a shame.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
Tell me about this theft,
Mr. Hyde!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Why?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
I want to find the man who
stole his work and make
him pay!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Look, you're a tough broad
and I like that, but it's too
late.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
The guy who plagiarized your 
son's novel already fessed
up.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
He's searching for your son
so he can clear things up
and make amends.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I think the real question is
whether or not your son
will forgive him.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
<m 160>I have faith that he will
forgive this man.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
I know my boy, Mr. Hyde.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
<m 007>Alan will surely forgive him.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
You seem pretty sure.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
That's just the way he is.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
His heart is large, and he has
forgiven greater trespasses
before this.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
After all, he forgave his own
mother for turning her back
on him...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
<color blue>She's finally going to spill it.<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>

Mr. Hyde, may I implore you
for a favor?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
Would you lend your ear to
a sad and shameful story?

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000103><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Years ago, you see, there
lived an absolute fool of
a woman.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
In her youth, she became
enraptured with show
business...and magic.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
But soon she married, and 
her husband convinced
her to settle down.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
She agreed... But her secret
heart yearned for a return
to the lights and the glory.

No, not at first. Their first
encounter was a simple
twist of fate.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
The woman had been called
to perform at the grand
opening of a new hotel.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
And by the strangest of
chances, her son was
invited to the same party.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
When she saw him, she was
filled with fear, and certain
he would be enraged.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
But instead he took her by
the hand and forgave her.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
That day, they made a promise
to each other.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
A promise to meet in ten 
years at that same hotel.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
And ten years later, they did
that very thing.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
The boy told her of his own
dream. Of how he longed to
become a writer.

And the woman presented her 
son with a small fountain pen 
to help him on his way. 
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
It was the first and last gift
she ever gave him... Or so
I hear.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
They made no more promises,
arranged no more meetings.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
The year after meeting her
son at the hotel, the woman
quietly retired.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
And this time, she walked 
away from the stage for
good.

That is the end of my story,
Mr. Hyde.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
Where she went and how she 
spent her days after that?
No one knows. 
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Yeah?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Well, let me tell you what I
heard.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
Oh?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The woman's son told his
thieving pal how much the
hotel meant to him.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Said it was his most special
place in the world.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
A place filled with memories
that he treasured more
than anything.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
At least, that's what I heard.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000710><n 0>
Oh, Mr. Hyde...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000121><n 0>
I think you should have this
pen. Maybe you can give it
back to its owner someday.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000703><n 0>
I... I don't have the words.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Anyway, sorry to take up all
your time. 

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'll see you around.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
What now?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
I thought perhaps you were
the one person I could tell
about my past, Mr. Hyde.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Yeah?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000708><n 0>
But obviously you are a man
who crashes through life
oblivious to emotions.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>
I have nothing more to say
to you.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000711><n 0>

You've officially hit a dead
end.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Never thought my search for
Bradley would get derailed
by a little old lady.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000112><n 0>
Guess that's what I get for
being such a sap.
