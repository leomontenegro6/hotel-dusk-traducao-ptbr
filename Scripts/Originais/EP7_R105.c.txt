If you are so inclined,

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
Mr. Hyde...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
I will be checking out of this

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
I will then proceed to the
offices of a local newspaper
and tell them my story.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
I believe they will enjoy the
tale of the famous author 
and his fall from grace.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
You see, I plan to use the

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Didn't see that one coming.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Well, it's about your buddy,
Alan.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
Alan, did you say?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You sure you got no idea
where he's at?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
Quite sure.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
No clues or leads or anything

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
No, nothing of the sort.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
But it's not like you went
out of your way to look
for the guy.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
And what, may I ask, do you
mean by that?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Common sense. It's better
for you if he's out of the
picture.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
It's about you being a low-
down book thief.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
Yes, the manuscript...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I didn't have plans to tell

You..."didn't" have plans?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
I... I see.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000814><n 0>
Well, then it is fortunate that 
I'm planning on telling my
tale to the public.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
If I may ask, to whom did you
reveal my secret?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000809><n 0>
Hmm?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The old lady in Room 212.
Name's Helen Parker.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000807><n 0>
Helen... Parker?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
She's the one who had the

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
Mr. Hyde...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I gave the pen back to her.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
The maid. Rosa.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000808><n 0>
What did you say?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
The person for whom you
requested my autograph?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Yeah, she's a fan of yours.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000813><n 0>
I...see...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
She must have been gravely
disappointed to learn of my
duplicity.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Could be.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
What is it?

Quite right.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
I was so surprised by your

my own topic.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Actually, it's about the woman
we met earlier in this very

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Who? Iris?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
Yes, that's her.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
I must say, she bears a

If you felt a sense of deja

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
There's a quite striking photo
of her doppelganger on this
month's issue of Va-Voom!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What kind of actress is this
Cecily Lee?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000802><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
My good man? Are you truly
unfamiliar with her?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
I don't get out much.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
She is an up-and-coming 
thespian who's garnered quite 
a bit of recent popularity.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
She got her start on one of
those tawdry daytime soap
operas.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
Her performance received
wild praise from critics
and fans alike!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
I believe she is scheduled to
make her debut on the
silver screen next year.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
Few people know that she was
a model before she took up
the craft of acting.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
She's not as young as the
other new starlets, but she
has a certain...something.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
That's quite the intro, 
Summer. You steal her
biography?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
Please, Mr. Hyde! I'm merely
reciting the information I've
heard.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
And I do not appreciate your
attempts at jocularity at my
expense.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000804><n 0>
The question, sir, is why would
Cecily Lee be staying in this
hotel on her own?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
It does arouse one's curiosity,
does it not?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
What is it?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000801><n 0>
What are you looking at, sir?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
What a coincidence! I, too,
am an avid reader of that
publication.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
Yes! That's her!


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, the voluptuous
creature on this cover

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
Aphrodite in a bathing suit. 
Striking, no?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
How fortunate for this
publication to have Cecily
Lee grace its cover.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000805><n 0>
She's quite an eyeful, don't
you agree?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000806><n 0>
That's the newspaper from
the lobby, isn't it?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
I've already read it, my good

I must tell you, the barkeep
makes a most satisfying
gin and tonic, sir.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00008FF><n 0>
Nothing quite like marriage
of lime and gin to pick up
one's spirits, eh?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000109><n 0>
Shut up and drink, Summer.
