When I returned to my room, it
felt...odd.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
<color red>Then I saw it! And it IS odd!<color white>


<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>

I'll tell you if you stop

My suitcase has been moved!
It's subtle, but it's definitely
been moved.
<!><color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Someone has been in my

<!><color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Whoever it was must have

broke in.
<sprite 0000125><!><color red>Was anything stolen?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>

Pardon?

Are you saying I'M odd?

How do you know about the

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
...A friend of mine works
there.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000913><n 0>
That's all.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You know the name of the
owner?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
No. Why? Are you going to tell
me that YOU own it?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
<m 021>Was anything stolen?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
...Yes.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You contact the front desk?
I hear Dunning has experience
with this kind of thing.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Not yet.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
I mean I should, but...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
There'll be so many questions,
and I hate questions.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
Besides, no one ever tries
to catch a thief unless 
lots of money is stolen.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So they didn't take your
money?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
That's right.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
...So what DID they take?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I can't say.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Then I can't help.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000910><n 0>
You would consider helping
me?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Depends on how cooperative
you are.

I lost a <color red>small envelope<color white>.


<sprite 0000125><color red>Wonder what was in it...<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So what was in this small
envelope? A small letter?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
I can't tell you.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I was sworn to secrecy,
Mr. Hyde. You must 
believe me.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
I made a promise to <color red>the<color white>
<color red>person who gave it to me<color white>.

<sprite 0000125><color red>You got it from someone else?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So someone gave you the
envelope, right?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Anything else you can tell
me? Was there anything
written on it?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
I can't say.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Then I can't help.

Good luck, lady.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000122><n 0>
I'm outta here.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
Why must you be such a
crass, insensitive lout?!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
Fine! Fine, I'll tell you!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
Just...give me a moment...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I'm impatient. Who gave it
to you?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
It was <color red>Grace<color white>.


<sprite 0000125><color red>Who the hell's Grace?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
You'll find her name written
on the back of the envelope.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You going to tell me who
Grace is?

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000912><n 0>
She's...a friend.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What kind of friend?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
She's a friend, Mr. Hyde!
What about that is so difficult
for you to comprehend?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
You may live your life all
alone under a rock
somewhere, but I...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
Oh, why am I talking to you
about this? It's none of your
business!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
None of my business? All
right, lady, whatever you say.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, what are you writing?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
What are you looking at?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
All right. I'm off.


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000902><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
I'll drop in if I find anything.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000904><n 0>
...Thank you. Helping me is
more kindness than I
expected.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Don't get used to it. I ain't
doing this for you.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
But then...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I'm just curious about what
got stolen. That's all.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000915><n 0>
You don't say?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Oh, but I do.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Got a hunch about your
mystery envelope and
whatever's inside it.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I think it's going to shine a
light on some shadows I've
been following around.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000909><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, what on earth are  
you talking about?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
See ya.

What is it?
