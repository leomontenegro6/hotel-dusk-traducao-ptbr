Didja hear how those two
cats were talkin' all quiet
and staticky?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Sounded like... I dunno. Like
someone bugged the room
or somethin', ya dig?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
That's my guess, too.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Where'd you get this thing,

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Trash can in the utility

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
The same person who stole 
an envelope from Iris's

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
OK, man, now you totally

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Fill me in, man. And use small

Yo, Hyde! Didja figure stuff

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
C'mon, man, hit me! What's
the deal with the tape?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
The tape was sent to Iris
by a woman named Grace.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Grace? Yo, I should know
this Grace or what?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
She's Iris's sister.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Iris has a SISTER? Seriously?
Awwwwooooooooo!!!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
...You're a moron, Louie.
There's more. Grace is
Melissa's mother.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Awwwooo... Huh? No joke?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Aw, wait, man! That means...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah. Grace is actually
Kevin's missing wife.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
Well, I'll be damned! You're
some kinda cop, Officer
Hyde!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Apparently Kevin isn't much
of a doctor, because he
lost a big malpractice suit.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Grace got the money to
pay the thing off, but
Kevin doesn't know how.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Aw, TRIP, man! Sounds like
dirty money to me!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You and me both, brother.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
About six months ago, Grace
up and vanished.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
That's the same time she
sent the tape to Iris.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Thing came with a letter 
that told her to sit tight
until Christmas.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
If there was no word by
then, Iris had to bring
the thing here.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Here, man? This hotel?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
She's supposed to give it
to a man who paints angels.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
That don't make no sense,
man.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I know, but there it is.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Yeah... There it is.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Listen, I need you to take 
a buzz through the guest
log from two years ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Sure, man. I'll do my sneakin'
around thing soon as
Dunning takes off.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
You want I should check if
Grace Woodward stayed
here, right?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Smart boy, Louie.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
If only my ma could see her
Louis now!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000405><n 0>

something like men.
...Men who ROLL!

You're on.
