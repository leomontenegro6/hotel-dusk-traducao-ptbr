Ed talks too much.

See what you can dig up on

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
And get me the skinny on the
owner, too. Guy named Robert

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Gallery May... Robert Evans...
Got it.

There's something here, Ed.

I met a young girl here.

She's wearing the same

to have.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Girl's name is Mila.

...Mila? Hyde, are you sayingµ


<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
No. It's not his sister.

Mila says the bracelet is from
her father. Robert Evans.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
I think she's looking for
the guy.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
This the same guy that owns

Looks like this gallery of

years ago.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
No kidding?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Yeah. It was one of the older
galleries in Santa Monica.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Seems this Evans fellow
inherited it from his
grandfather.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
He was twenty-three when
he got it, and that was back
in 1933.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Sounds like he had some
success.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>

for rare stuff.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Was real good at finding

famous painters.
<b 0168>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
He make any money?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>

a runner and disappears.
