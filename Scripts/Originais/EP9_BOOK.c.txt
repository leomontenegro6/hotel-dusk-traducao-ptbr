Something Rosa said got
me interested, and I take 
a look at all the apple
paintings in the hotel. 
I discover that a letter of
the alphabet is hidden in
each one.
There are five apple
paintings in all. Rosa tells
me that the last one's 
locked in Room 111. She 
gets me in to take a look,
and I figure out the
secret code hidden in 
the paintings.
I arrange the letters in 
the paintings and spell
the name Jenny. That 
name and Room 111 makes
Mila remember something,
and she faints dead away.
I use mouth-to-mouth and
revive Mila, and she comes
around and starts talking.
Who knew?
Mila finds her voice and
tells us how she came to 
the hotel ten years ago
with her old man. She says
she and Jenny were
playing in Room 111 when
a goon came in and took
Jenny away.
Kevin sees Mila leaving 111
and tells me that until six
months ago she was a
patient at his hospital.
Seems she was in a coma
for ten years, and her
recovery is some kind
of miracle.
Doc then tells me that
Mila's old man stopped
coming to see her right 
before she woke up. Also
tells me that a guy named
Kyle Hyde came to see
her.
I talk to Ed, and he tells 
me that ten years ago
Robert Evans owned the
Dusk. Then seven years
back Evans passed the
title for the hotel on to
Dunning.
I'm still processing this new
info when Rosa pops in 
to say that Dunning ran
off with Mila. I check out
Dunning's room, but no
one's there. I do find
some interesting things,
though.
Dunning had a collection
of birthday cards 
addressed to Jenny, an
old hotel brochure, and 
a newspaper article on
Osterzone.
I head to the wine cellar
to meet up with Louie, but
I find him unconscious on 
the ground. When I go
to check on him, someone
comes up from behind and
puts my lights out.
