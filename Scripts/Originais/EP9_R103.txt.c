I finally found Mila down in

Man, you shoulda said

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
I was looking for her too,

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
'Bout Mila?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
It's about her father.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Seems her old man went
missing seven years ago.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Trip, man. That's a long time
to be off the map.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
So, what? Mila's been lookin'

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Maybe.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Something rough happened
to her, but I don't know

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
I have to poke around some

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Yeah, well check this. I got
me some info, too!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
It's about that <color red>old key<color white>.

<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 0000102><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Oh, and I also did that B&E
that you wanted. To find out
'bout Melissa's ma.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Looked up the <color red>guest book<color white>

<sprite 0000125><color red>Was Grace here two years ago?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>

Man, what you want to know

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Just a hunch I need to check.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Rosa said there were five
paintings.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
But I can only find four.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000411><n 0>
Apples, huh? You sure you

again, Hyde?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000411><n 0>
OK, lemme think... Ya got the

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000405><n 0>
Yeah, and your room, too!
You remember that one?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I saw those.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
There's also one in 217 and
one at the end of the 
central hallway.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Oh, right! Right... Yeah, lemme
see... Naw, man, sorry. I

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So what's that key for?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
It's the key for the booze

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Probably not.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
Guess I had to try, yeah?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Anyways, this is the one key 
old man Dunning never let
me touch.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Didn't even keep a copy with
those other keys what he
keeps in the office.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But, man... Hidin' it inside a
PLANT? Never woulda

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
What a trip.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
Yeah, it's odd.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
So was Grace here two years

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
See, that's the thing, man...
I dunno.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Guest logs in the office only 
go back one year.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I got no idea if he tossed 
the old ones or what.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>

Yeah.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Well, just hurry up before

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
It was lyin' on the stairs.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
I ain't had a chance to listen

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Guess I'd better.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
You can use the box in

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>

We didn't see any sign of
hope, but then half a year
ago she just...came around.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
The attending physician was 
astonished.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
He called her recovery a 
miracle... Not that I take
stock in such things...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
But unfortunately, we had
trouble contacting her
<color red>family<color white>.

Her father used to come in
once a month and check
on her progress.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
His visits were clockwork.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
He came once a month for 
ten years?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
Without fail, but...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
But for some reason, he
never appeared after she
woke up.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
<s 4003010>Sounds like he picked a bad
time to hang it up.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
Yes, perhaps...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
<m 021>We tried several times to
contact him, but...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
He never returned our
calls.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
Oh, and the bills. The bills
had all been paid in
advance.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
No one ever came to see
her besides her father.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001016><n 0>
He may have no idea what
has happened.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
You ever meet her old man?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001001><n 0>
No, I just... I heard about it
from the nurses and such.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000114><n 0>

Of course. The attending

He was unable to locate
anyone.

I mean, the hospital, they
tried to notify this Hyde
fellow, but to no avail.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0001004><n 0>
Mr. Hyde, did you visit Mila
before she woke up?
