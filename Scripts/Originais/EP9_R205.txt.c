Listen, I just heard a little
chestnut about Evans.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You sitting down?



bought himself a little
place called...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Hotel Dusk.



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Robert Evans bought this
hotel?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Yeah. Seems Evans bought
the thing in 1969.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
He owned it for three years, 
then sold it to some mope
for a song.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
So he sold it seven years
ago?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You must be tired, Hyde.
You're repeating everything.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Anyway, he sold it to Dunning 
Smith. You probably met
him by now.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
I don't know what you found
here, Hyde, but that place
has a troubled history.
<b 0133>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
Tell me.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Dusk used to be a real party
joint, but in 1969 it just shut
down. You follow me?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Means Evans shut the place
down the moment he
bought it!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Now why the hell would a
guy do a thing like that?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Who buys a business just to
shut it down?

<b 0110>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
And why'd he sell it to
Dunning Smith?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
My thinking is that Evans
played Smith and dumped 
the place, but I don't know.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
Lotsa questions here, Hyde.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
You might not like where this 
night of sleuthing ends up.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00015FF><n 0>
I'd get ready for a bad
surprise.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
But then I... I told him. Oh,
what a fool thing I did!


and that we knew why she
had come here.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Then he said there was
no need to call the police
at all!

was going to have a little
chat, and he took her away!
