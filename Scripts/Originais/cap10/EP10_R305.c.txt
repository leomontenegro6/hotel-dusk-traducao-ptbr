<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Because his childhood friend

Let me lay it out for you.
Danny was killed trying

It was in a warehouse run by

A painting of an angel.

Three years ago, he was

We ate dinner, and then he

The door opened, and there

He grabbed Jenny and tried

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000518><n 0>
Jenny started screaming.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000518><n 0>
She was crying so hard.

I...I thought she was going

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000521><n 0>
So I yelled at the man! I

Mila was in a coma. Spent

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Then six months ago she

Evans wouldn't do somethin'

him.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
It was Nile.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Likely as not.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Leastwise, that's what Evans

<sprite 0000125><color red>Why'd you tell him no?<color white>
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
And that's why they took

What did Bradley tell you?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000202><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Night he stayed here, your

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Well, one turned into a whole

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
That's when Bradley stops

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Some stranger asking you

<e 41>Hell, no! What kinda fool ya

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000203><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
No way I was gonna tell some

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
...Then he looked up and  
stared me square'n the eye.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Told me he was being chased 
by Nile.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000202><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Hell, I dunno. Three years 
after I lost m'Jenny, I...
I hit rock bottom.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
I was sad and pissed off. Told
him I knew Jenny ain't
never comin' home.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
Took a knife to the paintings
I was workin' on and slashed
'em to ribbons.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
I was even thinkin' 'bout
breakin' m'hand so I couldn't
paint no more.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Well, Evans saw how crazy I 
was.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>
He talked me back from the 
edge. Said he'd take care
of everythin'.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>
Promised me he'd get m'Jenny 
back.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>
Said I should just sit tight
and wait here.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>
And that he'd contact me soon
as everythin' was square.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000211><n 0>
Then he turned'n walked off
the face of the earth.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>

Yup. 


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
It introduced the world to
the mystery painter that

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
In less time'n it takes t'change

off.

Collectors started buyin' up

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Evans'n me were just happy
as pigs in filth.

Art world loved Osterzone.
And loved his paintings.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I just kept paintin' and paintin' 
as much as I could.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
And Evans sold every last one

Evans liked our scam. He liked

He started lookin' for other

But one day I had enough.
Told 'em all to go t'hell.

That's when Evans sent me

"Go back to the Dusk.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
He sent me the deed to this

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>
I tried to track'm down, but...
Like I said earlier, I ain't

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000217><n 0>

I didn't have no idea how
to start lookin' for him...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
So I just decided t'stay here
and wait 'er out.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I made a promise to m'self,
ya understand?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I was gonna wait here for 
m'Jenny, and if I died waitin',
so much the better.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
So five years back, I opened 
the Dusk back up again. But
no one wanted t'stay here.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
People heard stories 'bout the 
night Jenny was taken and...
Well, it kept 'em away.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
So I made up that load'a crap 
'bout the wish room and told
a buncha newspapers.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Then I tried t'run the place.
...Guess ya can tell I ain't
much of a people person.

"Ya can't change anything.

So then yer pal finished his

And I asked him what he done

I took Angel Openin' a Door
off the wall and carried 'er 
down to the basement.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
Then I covered the damn
thing with a coat'a white
paint.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
I just wanted to forget 
everythin' I knew 'bout
Mr. Robert Evans.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000201><n 0>
That's why I locked up 217 
and didn't let no one stay
there anymore.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000224><n 0>
I got to thinkin' somethin' bad
