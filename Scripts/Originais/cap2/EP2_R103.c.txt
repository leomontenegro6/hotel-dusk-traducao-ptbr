I did hear Louis call you

There's no mistaking that,

WHAT?!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000308><n 0>
What did you say? He was

And in all that time, he's

not out to hurt people.

And he hasn't changed a bit.
Just doing what he needs

He worked in a jewelry

Louie was ever a criminal.

He's a professional slacker.
He doesn't have the stones
to be a crook.
