This stuff still interest you?
Even though ya ain't a cop
anymore?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Guess so.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Crimes and criminals still
get my blood going.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
You don't just walk away.
No one does.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Ha! Still the same ol' Officer
Hyde!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Ya know, you look real weird
without a badge and a gun,
man.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
You always seemed like a
"cop for life" kind of cat,
ya dig?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Yeah.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
So about this incident. 
What happened?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
I heard about it from this
gabby guy over at the
newspaper stand.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Seems a man and his
daughter stopped here
for a night, yeah?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Then, in the middle of the
night,<color red> <color white>the <color red>girl disappeared<color white>.

<sprite 0000125><color red>She disappeared?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
She disappeared?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Yeah. Kid was only ten years
old, too. 

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Father looked all over for 
her, but the sun came up
and she was still gone.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Later on, the cops got a 
mysterious letter...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
It told 'em where they could
<color red>find the girl's body<color white>.

<sprite 0000125><color red>Did they find the body?<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Did they find the girl's
body?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
No, that's the crazy part.
Guy told me they didn't find
squat.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 00004FF><n 0>
No kid, no crook, no nothin'.
Thing's still unsolved.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
...That so?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Yep. And after that, the
stories started.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
The murdered chick's ghost
appears at night and...acts
scary or whatever.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Might have been a crock,
but it <color red>kept folks away and<color white>
<color red>bankrupted the place<color white>.
<sprite 0000124><color red>ÅI<color white>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 00001FF><n 0>
<color blue>Bankrupted the place?<color white>


<color white><screen left><wait no><sprite 00001FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Now we're getting 
somewhere.

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 00004FF><n 0>



<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
When did all this go down?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
After the girl vanished, so... 
Musta been about ten years
back.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Then old man Dunning comes
along and buys up the place
'bout five years later.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Anyhow, that's all I know.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Dunning and Rosa don't like
to talk about it.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Place went under, huh?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Yeah. Bottoms up. Place was
deserted till Dunning rolled
in 'bout five years ago.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
He picked the place up for
nothin' and bam! Hotel Dusk
is open for business.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Anyways, that's all I know.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Dunning and Rosa don't like
to talk about it.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
What kind of girl is Mila?


<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000402><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000407><n 0>

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
She was in the lobby earlier,
right? Girl with the long
hair?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000404><n 0>
Met her already, eh?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000405><n 0>
She's a looker, right?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
I guess.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000413><n 0>
Nothin' changes. <color red>You never<color white>
<color red>had much of an eye for the <color white>
<color red>ladies, Hyde.<color white>

had an eye for the ladies?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
C'mon, Hyde...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Girl's a total fox! What, you
blind, you can't see that?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Little girls don't interest
me, Louie.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
See? That's what I'm sayin',
man! You don't know squat! 

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
What're you babbling about?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Girl's a butterfly, man! She's,

transformation, ya know?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
She's gonna climb outta her
cocoon and shine, brother!
Just you wait!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Why'd you say nothing
changes?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>

You're like some dinosaur
stuck in a tar pit.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
I know your history, Officer
Hyde. You only fall for
chicks with...ya know...

Issues.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
...How's that?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Sure! Detective Kyle Hyde
of the fightin' 89th and his
whacked-out lady lover...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
All us street rats knew the
story, man. It was famous.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
Really?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
...Yeah. Guess I shoulda 
kept my head hole shut,

What?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
So you quit the beat and
left the city, yeah?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
You come all the way out
here to avoid cats from
your past?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
That's part of it.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
But I was born out here,
too.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
My mom and I only moved
to New York after my old
man passed.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Figured I could use my old
contacts to get back on
my feet.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Yeah, I dig.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000115><n 0>
And, well...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Well, what? Don't leave me
hangin', man!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
I'm looking for someone.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Lookin' for someone? Get  
outta here! You ain't a cop 
no more!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Not like that. It's just a 
guy I used to work with
who went missing.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
A guy you worked with?
What, like a cop?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah, my ex-partner, Bradley.
Don't think you ever had
the pleasure.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Bradley, huh?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
Yeah.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Why's he missing?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
He got shot at the docks
three years ago and took
a dive in the Hudson.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Three years ago?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Something wrong?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000415><n 0>
No, no! Not really. No.
It's nothin'.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
But ya know... If the cat's
been outta sight for three
years...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Well, kinda safe to assume
he's dead. Ain't it?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
No. He's alive.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Hey, I know you guys were
tight and all, so you want
him to be alive...
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
But you gotta let go. Dead
is dead, right?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000114><n 0>
