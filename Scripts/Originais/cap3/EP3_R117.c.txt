I truly am!

It's just that there's nothing

I'm used to doing everything

No one helps old Rosa!

Hello there, Mr. Hyde.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000704><n 0>
Have you already eaten?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Yeah.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
And how is the restaurant
fare? I do hope it's tasty!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Yeah, it's pretty good.
...Which shocked me.

Truly? Well, that certainly

By the way, Mr. Hyde, I have
a bit of a favor to ask of
you.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
Can you spare a moment
for this poor old woman?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
...What?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000712><n 0>
I was wondering if you  
wouldn't mind escorting me
to the restaurant.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000701><n 0>
I had some trouble with my

You seem healthy to me.
I'm sure you can make it

Maybe Dunning has a walker

Found it in the restaurant.

It was on the floor under

Really? Figured it had to be
yours, man.

That's harsh. Wonder who
it belongs to...

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000120><n 0>
Look here. There are words
