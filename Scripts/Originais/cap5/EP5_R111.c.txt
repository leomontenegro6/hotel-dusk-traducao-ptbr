Dunning's thinking 'bout callin'
in the cops on this, and
LAPD is no joke!

You gotta watch your step,
brother!

...You're right.

Last thing I need is to get
caught up in Hollywood
drama.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
Especially now that I found
a lead on Bradley.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Hold it! You got a lead?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Did you find somethin' in
Room 217?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
A lighter.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
A lighter?


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That's right. Looks just like
the one Bradley carried.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000408><n 0>
So the cat what stayed here 
six months ago under your
name was...
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
That's my hunch.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Yeah, but if that's true...


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Why'd the dude use your
name, man?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
And why's he stayin' here in
the first place?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
No clue, Louie. That's what
I've got to find out.

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000117><n 0>
But first I have to clear up
these distractions.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
I dig ya, brother.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
That punk Jeff's plannin'
something!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
We gotta make him talk!


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Gotta find out why he's tryin'
to set you up!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
My thoughts exactly.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000405><n 0>
We gotta trick him, yeah? Make
him slip up and do something
stupid!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
He ain't from the streets! He's
some spoiled rich punk! We can
roll him, easy!
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
All right, Louie, let's do it.


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000141><n 0>
How do we play it?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000411><n 0>
Yeah, I guess... Hmm... Wait!
Wait, we could... Nah...

<color white><screen right><wait no><sprite 0000411><n 0>



<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
OK, got it! Check this out,
my man!

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000124><n 0>
Yeah?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
I get Jeff to come outta his
room, right?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
And then while he's gone...


<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000107><n 0>
I go in and give the place a
quick shakedown.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Bingo! I bet my last dime
there's something in his
room that'll nail him.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000102><n 0>
I think you're right.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
So you want I should go ahead
and set the trap?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000420><n 0>
Ya got any dirty cop tricks I
can use? Beat sticks or sweet 
talk or that kinda crap?

OK, let's go in five.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000416><n 0>
All ya gotta do is go and wait
in Room 217, yeah?

<s 1017010>Louie finishes talking and
rushes out of the room.

Think you can create a
distraction?

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
Yeah, yeah. I can do that.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Punk's in Room 213, and the
room next to him is vacant.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
So Room 214's where I'll do my
thing.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
I'll go there and...uh...get his
attention by makin' a buncha
loud noises or something.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
That's some plan.


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
Don't sweat me, man! Look, I'll
get him outta his room!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Then I'll just keep him busy
for a while, ya dig?

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
I guess that'll work.

<r 111_R>

<r 111_L>
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000105><n 0>
Keep it simple. Give him a call
and get him out of the room.

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
A call? That's it? C'mon, man,
I wanna be like Kojak and bust
down his door or something.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000410><n 0>
Man, you're such a drag...
All right, I'll just go and tell
him I found his dough.
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>
Where?


<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000403><n 0>
Uh...in the...utility closet. 
Yeah, I'll have him follow
me down there.
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000401><n 0>
Then I'll mess with the lock
and keep him busy for a few. 

<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000103><n 0>
Got it.
