I'm still in the bar when
Summer rolls in and tells
me that he thinks Iris is 
really an up-and-coming 
actress named Cecily Lee.
I leave the bar and run
into Melissa, who's looking
for her old man.
Melissa tells me she didn't
get a Christmas tree this 
year, so I dig a tree out 
of storage and decorate
it for her. Mila and Louie 
swing by, and we have
ourselves a belated
Christmas shindig.
Melissa conks out, so I get
Louie to take her back to
her room. Mila and I keep
talking, and I find out 
that her father owned an
art gallery called Gallery
May. Seems that Mila came
here looking for him.
I meet Kevin in the lobby 
and tell him to go find his
kid, but the good doctor
is three sheets to the 
wind. I return to the bar,
where Louie tells me the
doc was talking about
Gallery May with Iris.
I'm curious about the
gallery, so I find Iris and
ask about it. I learn that
a friend of hers used to
work there. Then, in a
panic, she tells me that
someone took an envelope
from her suitcase.
I want to know what's in
the envelope, so I tell Iris
I'll shake the trees and
see what falls out.
I find Kevin trying to
sober up. I wave away the
fumes and ask him some
questions. He's belligerent,
but he eventually tells me
why his wife left him.
Seems he screwed up and
got sued for malpractice.
Grace somehow came up 
with the money to settle
the suit, but wouldn't tell 
Kevin where she got it.
With all trust gone, they
started fighting all the
time, and she eventually
hit the road.
Kevin also tells me that
Grace worked at Gallery
May before they were
married, and that she 
stayed at Hotel Dusk two
years ago.
