Oh, hello, Mr. Hyde. Sigh...

Glad I inspire such high

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
Well, Mr. Summer just came
up to me and...

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
He asked me the strangest
thing!

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
He asked me to return his

it?
<color white><screen left><wait yes><sprite 0000106><n 0>

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
Exactly! I don't know what I'm
supposed to do. 

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000306><n 0>
I can't very well erase it...and
I'm not giving him my book!
I don't care if he wrote it!
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
And when I asked him what
was wrong? And why he
needed it back?
<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
He just kept saying the same
thing over and over; "You

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000310><n 0>
And he was red in the face!
It was like talking to a

<color white><screen right><wait yes><sprite 0000311><n 0>
What sent him over the edge?
I swear I just don't know!
